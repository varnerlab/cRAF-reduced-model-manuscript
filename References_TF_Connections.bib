	Abstract = {Retinoic acid (RA) is used to treat leukemia and other cancers through its ability to promote cancer cell differentiation. Strategies to enhance the anticancer effects of RA could deepen and broaden its beneficial therapeutic applications. In this study, we describe a receptor cross-talk system that addresses this issue. RA effects are mediated by RAR/RXR receptors that we show are modified by interactions with the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), a protein functioning both as a transcription factor and a ligand-dependent adaptor in an ubiquitin ligase complex. RAR/RXR and AhR pathways cross-talk at the levels of ligand-receptor and also receptor-promoter interactions. Here, we assessed the role of AhR during RA-induced differentiation and a hypothesized convergence at Oct4, a transcription factor believed to maintain stem cell characteristics. RA upregulated AhR and downregulated Oct4 during differentiation of HL-60 promyelocytic leukemia cells. AhR overexpression in stable transfectants downregulated Oct4 and also decreased ALDH1 activity, another stem cell-associated factor, enhancing RA-induced differentiation as indicated by cell differentiation markers associated with early (CD38 and CD11b) and late (neutrophilic respiratory burst) responses. AhR overexpression also increased levels of activated Raf1, which is known to help propel RA-induced differentiation. RNA interference-mediated knockdown of Oct4 enhanced RA-induced differentiation and G(0) cell-cycle arrest relative to parental cells. Consistent with the hypothesized importance of Oct4 downregulation for differentiation, parental cells rendered resistant to RA by biweekly high RA exposure displayed elevated Oct4 levels that failed to be downregulated. Together, our results suggested that therapeutic effects of RA-induced leukemia differentiation depend on AhR and its ability to downregulate the stem cell factor Oct4.},

@article{Shen2011,
	Abstract = {All-trans retinoic acid (RA) and interferons (IFNs) have efficacy in treating certain leukemias and lymphomas, respectively, motivating interest in their mechanism of action to improve therapy. Both RA and IFNs induce interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1). We find that in HL-60 myeloblastic leukemia cells which undergo mitogen activated protien kinase (MAPK)-dependent myeloid differentiation in response to RA, IRF-1 propels differentiation. RA induces MAPK-dependent expression of IRF-1. IRF-1 binds c-Cbl, a MAPK related adaptor. Ectopic IRF-1 expression causes CD38 expression and activation of the Raf/MEK/ERK axis, and enhances RA-induced differentiation by augmenting CD38, CD11b, respiratory burst and G0 arrest. Ectopic IRF-1 expression also decreases the activity of aldehyde dehydrogenase 1, a stem cell marker, and enhances RA-induced ALDH1 down-regulation. Interestingly, expression of aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), which is RA-induced and known to down-regulate Oct4 and drive RA-induced differentiation, also enhances IRF-1 expression. The data are consistent with a model whereby IRF-1 acts downstream of RA and AhR to enhance Raf/MEK/ERK activation and propel differentiation.},

@article{Suh2002,
	Abstract = {B cells have been identified as sensitive cellular targets responsible for 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD)-mediated suppression of humoral immunity. In previous studies, TCDD was shown to produce a significant inhibition of IgM secretion and mu gene expression in LPS-activated CH12.LX B cells (AhR expressing) but not in BCL-1 B cells (AhR deficient). The present studies extend these previous findings by investigating the effect of TCDD on AP-1 and nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB, both of which play an important role in B-cell activation, differentiation, and immunoglobulin (Ig) gene expression. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays and chloramphenicol acetyl transferase reporter gene experiments demonstrated that lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced DNA binding and transcriptional activity of AP-1 was markedly inhibited by TCDD at 24, 48, and 72 h after cellular activation of CH12.LX cells. Conversely, TCDD treatment produced no significant change on the activity of NF-kappaB. Two AhR antagonists, alpha-naphthoflavone and 2,2',5,5'-tetrachlorobiphenyl, attenuated TCDD-induced inhibition of AP-1 binding in CH12.LX cells. Concordant with this result, TCDD did not inhibit LPS-induced AP-1 activity in BCL-1 B cells. Moreover, supershift analysis revealed the major component of the AP-1 complex in LPS-activated CH12.LX cells was c-Jun. Additional studies revealed that the nuclear c-jun and c-jun steady-state mRNA expression was inhibited by TCDD treatment. Collectively, these results suggest that TCDD-induced inhibition of IgM expression by B cells may be mediated, at least in part, through a down-regulation of AP-1 activity in an AhR-dependent manner.},

@article{Chen2004,
	Abstract = {Advances in differentiation therapy of cancer are likely to depend on improved understanding of molecular events that underlie cell differentiation. We reported recently that cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk)5 and p35Nck5a (p35) are expressed in human leukemia HL60 cells induced to differentiate to monocytes by an exposure to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) (1,25D(3)), form a complex, and this complex has kinase activity (F. Chen and G. P. Studzinski, Blood 2001;97:3763). This laboratory has also provided evidence that the extracellular signal-regulated kinase/mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway is active in the early (24-48 h) stages of HL60 cell differentiation induced by 1,25D(3) but declines in the later, terminal phase of this form of differentiation (X. Wang and G. P. Studzinski, J Cell Biochem 2001;80:471). We examine now the hypothesis that Egr1 protein contributes to the up-regulation of p35 gene transcription and, thus, activated Cdk5/p35 kinase phosphorylates and inactivates mitogen-activated protein/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase 1 (MEK1). Our data show that in 1,25D(3)-treated cells, p35 and Egr1 protein levels are elevated in a dose-dependent manner at the onset of the late stage of differentiation. We show also that 1,25D(3) treatment of HL60 cells markedly increases the binding of Egr1 to an element in the p35 gene promoter, whereas transfection of an excess of this Egr1-binding oligonucleotide ("promoter decoy") reduces p35 gene transcription and cell differentiation. Additionally, Cdk5/p35 phosphorylates MEK1 and inhibits its ability to phosphorylate its downstream target Erk2. These data suggest that in 1,25D(3)-treated HL60 cells, Egr1 up-regulates p35 gene transcription and that Cdk5/p35 kinase inactivates the extracellular signal-regulated kinase/mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway by phosphorylation of MEK1, and this contributes to terminal differentiation of these cells.},

@article{Fu2002,
	Abstract = {To explore the molecular mechanisms of PPARgamma1 gene expression in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC), we hypothesized that early growth-response factor-1 (Egr-1) might be a transcriptional mediator of the growth factor- and cytokine-induced PPARgamma1 gene expression since a putative Egr-1 binding element was found in the human PPARgamma1 promoter. In this study, we document that overexpression of Egr-1 activates the human PPARgamma1 promoter in both VSMC and HepG2 cells. Using Northern blot analysis, we observed that growth factors and cytokines such as PDGF, bFGF, Ang II, TNFalpha, and IL-1beta induce Egr-1 expression prior to PPARgamma1 up-regulation in human VSMC. In addition, overexpression of a constitutively active form of Egr-1 by adenoviral gene transfer in VSMC dramatically induced PPARgamma1 gene expression by 6-8-fold, and overexpression of NAB2, a potent negative feedback regulator of Egr-1, abrogated the growth factor- and cytokine-induced PPARgamma1 expression in VSMC. Furthermore, we demonstrate with gel mobility shift and transient transfection assays that the putative Egr-1 element in the human PPARgamma1 promoter specifically binds Egr-1 protein and becomes trans-activated by Egr-1. Taken together, our data demonstrate for the first time that Egr-1 is necessary and sufficient to activate human PPARgamma1 gene expression in VSMC.},

@article{Johnson1994,
	Abstract = {Both positive and negative signals govern the progression of cells from G1 into S phase, and a variety of data implicate the E2F transcription factor as a target for the action of one class of negative regulators, the Rb family of growth suppressors. We now find that the E2F1 gene, which encodes one of the components of E2F activity, is subject to autoregulatory control during progression from G0 to S phase and that this primarily reflects a negative control in G0 and early G1, a time when the majority of E2F activity exits as a complex with Rb family members. In addition, we find that deregulated expression of G1 cyclins in quiescent cells stimulates the E2F1 promoter and that this is augmented by coexpression of cyclin-dependent kinases in an E2F-dependent manner. We conclude that the E2F1 gene is a downstream target for G1 cyclin-dependent kinase activity, most likely as a consequence of phosphorylation of Rb family members, and that the autoregulation of E2F1 transcription may provide a sensitive switch for regulating the accumulation of E2F activity during the transition from G1 to S phase.},

	Abstract = {The cell cycle inhibitor protein p21(WAF1/Cip1) (p21) is a critical downstream effector in p53-dependent mechanisms of growth control and p53-independent pathways of terminal differentiation. We have recently reported that the transforming growth factor-beta pathway-specific Smad3 and Smad4 proteins transactivate the human p21 promoter via a short proximal region, which contains multiple binding sites for the ubiquitous transcription factor Sp1. In the present study we show that the Sp1-occupied promoter region mediates transactivation of the p21 promoter by c-Jun and the related proteins JunB, JunD, and ATF-2. By using gel electrophoretic mobility shift assays we show that this region does not contain a binding site for c-Jun. In accordance with the DNA binding data, c-Jun was unable to transactivate the p21 promoter when overexpressed in the Sp1-deficient Drosophila-derived SL2 cells. Coexpression of c-Jun and Sp1 in these cells resulted in a strong synergistic transactivation of this promoter. In addition, a chimeric promoter consisting of six tandem high affinity Sp1-binding sites fused with the CAT gene was transactivated by overexpressed c-Jun in HepG2 cells. The above data propose functional cooperation between c-Jun and Sp1. Physical interactions between the two factors were demonstrated in vitro by using GST-Sp1 hybrid proteins expressed in bacteria and in vitro transcribed-translated c-Jun. The region of c-Jun mediating interaction with Sp1 was mapped within the basic region leucine zipper domain. In vivo, functional interactions between c-Jun and Sp1 were demonstrated using a GAL4-based transactivation assay. Overexpressed c-Jun transactivated a chimeric promoter consisting of five tandem GAL4-binding sites only when coexpressed with GAL4-Sp1-(83-778) fusion proteins in HepG2 cells. By utilizing the same assay, we found that the glutamine-rich segment of the B domain of Sp1 (Bc, amino acids 424-542) was sufficient for c-Jun-induced transactivation of the p21 promoter. In conclusion, our data support a mechanism of superactivation of Sp1 by c-Jun, which is based on physical and functional interactions between these two transcription factors on the human p21 and possibly other Sp1-dependent promoters.},

@article{Behre1999,
	Abstract = {The ETS domain transcription factor PU.1 is necessary for the development of monocytes and regulates, in particular, the expression of the monocyte-specific macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) receptor, which is critical for monocytic cell survival, proliferation, and differentiation. The bZIP transcription factor c-Jun, which is part of the AP-1 transcription factor complex, is also important for monocytic differentiation, but the monocyte-specific M-CSF receptor promoter has no AP-1 consensus binding sites. We asked the question of whether c-Jun could promote the induction of the M-CSF receptor by collaborating with PU.1. We demonstrate that c-Jun enhances the ability of PU.1 to transactivate the M-CSF receptor promoter as well as a minimal thymidine kinase promoter containing only PU.1 DNA binding sites. c-Jun does not directly bind to the M-CSF receptor promoter but associates via its basic domain with the ETS domain of PU.1. Consistent with our observation that AP-1 binding does not contribute to c-Jun coactivation is the observation that the activation of PU.1 by c-Jun is blocked by overexpression of c-Fos. Phosphorylation of c-Jun by c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase on Ser-63 and -73 does not alter the ability of c-Jun to enhance PU.1 transactivation. Activated Ras enhances the transcriptional activity of PU.1 by up-regulating c-Jun expression without changing the phosphorylation pattern of PU.1. The activation of PU.1 by Ras is blocked by a mutant c-Jun protein lacking the basic domain. The expression of this mutant form of c-Jun also completely blocks 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate-induced M-CSF receptor promoter activity during monocytic differentiation. We propose therefore that c-Jun acts as a c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase-independent coactivator of PU.1, resulting in M-CSF receptor expression and development of the monocytic lineage.},

	Abstract = {PU.1 (spi-1), a member of the Ets transcription factor family, is predominantly expressed in myeloid and B cells, activates many B cell and myeloid genes, and is critical for development of both of these lineages. Our previous studies (Chen, H. M., Ray-Gallet, D., Zhang, P., Hetherington, C. J., Gonzalez, D. A., Zhang, D.-E., Moreau-Gachelin, F., and Tenen, D. G. (1995) Oncogene 11, 1549-1560) demonstrate that the PU.1 promoter directs cell type-specific reporter gene expression in myeloid cell lines, and that PU.1 activates its own promoter in an autoregulatory loop. Here we show that the murine PU.1 promoter is also specifically and highly functional in B cell lines as well. Oct-1 and Oct-2 can bind specifically to a site at base pair -55 in vitro, and this site is specifically protected in B cells in vivo. We also demonstrate that two other sites contribute to promoter activity in B cells; an Sp1 binding site adjacent to the octamer site, and the PU.1 autoregulatory site. Finally, we show that the B cell coactivator OBF-1/Bob1/OCA-B is only expressed in B cells and not in myeloid cells, and that OBF-1/Bob1/OCA-B can transactivate the PU.1 promoter in HeLa and myeloid cells. This B cell restricted coactivator may be responsible for the B cell specific expression of PU.1 mediated by the octamer site.},

	Abstract = {Small changes in the concentrations and/or combinations of trans-acting factors can result in profound alterations in gene expression. Synergistic interaction between different classes of transcription factors bound to distinct sites within a promoter/enhancer region is one mechanism by which this can occur. Reflecting this, hormone response elements, DNA recognition sites for steroid/nuclear receptors, are often found in promoter regions organized as multiple copies or are clustered among binding sites for other trans-acting factors. To systematically examine the potential interactions between one such receptor, the vitamin D3 receptor (VDR), and other nonreceptor transcription factors, we constructed a series of reporter plasmids containing one copy of the osteopontin (Spp1) vitamin D response element (VDRE), consisting of two direct repeats spaced by 3 base pairs, and one binding site for the transcription factors SP1, NF-1, Oct-1, or AP-1. We also generated reporters either under the control of two copies of Spp1 VDRE, or a distinct VDRE from the human osteocalcin gene promoter. The various reporters were used to transiently transfect HeLa or CV-1 cells in the presence and absence of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3. Our results show that VDR transactivates 12-20 times more strongly from two Spp1-VDREs than from one, indicating that VDR synergizes with itself. VDR also synergizes with the other nonreceptor factors, since we observe a 6- to 12-fold degree of synergistic induction after ligand addition, depending on the particular factor. The functional basis for the transcriptional synergism appears to be at the level of cooperative DNA binding, at least for VDR alone and VDR-Oct-1, as demonstrated in vitro by gel mobility shift assays using purified factors. Consistent with this, we show that the minimal requirement for transcriptional synergism in vivo by VDR is its DNA-binding domain.},

	Abstract = {Gfi-1 is a zinc finger transcriptional repressor originally recognized for its role in T cell differentiation and lymphomas. Recent experiments reveal that gene-targeted Gfi-1-deficient mice are neutropenic and that Gfi-1 mutations cause human neutropenia. In both cases, myeloid progenitor cells lose the ability to distinctly differentiate granulocytes from monocytes. The molecular mechanism of the hematopoietic abnormalities caused by Gfi-1 deficiency remains undetermined because of a lack of known Gfi-1 target genes. To identify Gfi-1 targets in vivo, we performed large-scale chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis on a set of 34 candidate genes in myeloblast (KG-1 and HL-60), monoblast (U937), and T lymphocyte cell lines (Jurkat), in concert with RT-PCR-based expression profiling. We identified 32 Gfi-1 binding sites in a functionally variable set of 16 genes, including complements of cell-cycle regulators, transcription factors, and granulocyte-specific markers. Cluster analysis of expression patterns and chromatin immunoprecipitation data reveals that Gfi-1 targets a subset of genes differentiating hematopoietic lineages and therefore plays a relatively superior role in the hierarchy of factors governing stem cell differentiation.},

	Abstract = {Mice lacking the zinc finger transcriptional repressor protein GFI-1 are neutropenic. These mice generate abnormal immature myeloid cells exhibiting characteristics of both macrophages and granulocytes. Furthermore, Gfi-1(-/-) mice are highly susceptible to bacterial infection. Interestingly, Gfi-1(-/-) myeloid cells overexpress target genes of the PU.1 transcription factor such as the macrophage colony-stimulating factor receptor and PU.1 itself. We therefore determined whether GFI-1 modulates the transcriptional activity of PU.1. Our data demonstrate that GFI-1 physically interacts with PU.1, repressing PU.1-dependent transcription. This repression is functionally significant, as GFI-1 blocked PU.1-induced macrophage differentiation of a multipotential hematopoietic progenitor cell line. Retroviral expression of GFI-1 in primary murine hematopoietic progenitors increased granulocyte differentiation at the expense of macrophage differentiation. We interbred Gfi-1(+/-) and PU.1(+/-) mice and observed that heterozygosity at the PU.1 locus partially rescued the Gfi-1(-/-) mixed myeloid lineage phenotype, but failed to restore granulocyte differentiation. Our data demonstrate that GFI-1 represses PU.1 activity and that lack of this repression in Gfi-1(-/-) myeloid cells contributes to the observed mixed lineage phenotype.},

	Abstract = {Activating mutations in ras oncogenes occur at high frequency in human malignancies and expression of activated ras in immortalized cells lines is generally transforming. However, somewhat paradoxically, ectopic expression of ras in some myeloid cell lines has been shown to induce growth suppression associated with up-regulation of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21(CIP1/WAF1) in a p16(INK4a), p15(INK4b), and p53 independent fashion. We have used cDNA array technology to compare the expression profile induced by activated N-ras (N-rasG13R) in growth-suppressed myeloid cells with that induced in myeloid cells, which are transformed by N-rasG13R. The expression profile induced in growth suppressed cells was consistent with differentiation and included the up-regulation of the transcription factor IFN regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1), a known transcriptional activator of p21(CIP/WAF1) expression and a target of oncogenic mutations associated with myeloid leukemia. Antisense suppression of IRF-1 prevented N-rasG13R-associated growth arrest and up-regulation of p21(CIP1/WAF1). These results define a novel tumor suppressive response to oncogenic signaling and provide a mechanistic link between growth suppression and differentiation in myeloid cells.},

	Abstract = {The activation antigen CD38, which has NAD+ glycohydrolase activity in its extracellular domain, is expressed by a large variety of cell types. Few investigations into the regulation of CD38 expression by physiologic stimuli have been reported. As the CD38 promoter contains potential binding sites for interferon (IFN) regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1), we investigated the influence of IFN type I (alpha and beta) and type II (gamma) on CD38 gene expression of leukemic B cells. Using the IFN-responsive B cell line Eskol, we found by RT-PCR analysis a rapid time-dependent induction in CD38 mRNA (starting at 6 h) with each type of IFN. This induction was independent of protein synthesis, suggesting that CD38 gene activation does not require IRF-1 but is merely under direct transcriptional regulation by latent IFN-inducible factors. mRNA stimulation was followed within 24 h by induction of membrane CD38, which coincided with rises of CD38-specific ectoenzymatic activities, that is, NAD+ glycohydrolase, (A/G)DP-ribosyl cyclase, and cyclic ADP ribose hydrolase activities. IFN failed to induce or upregulate the other CD38-related ectoenzymes analyzed, that is, CD39, CD73, CD157, and PC-1. Similarly, treatment of leukemic cells of patients with B chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) with IFN resulted in an increase in CD38 mRNA mirrored by plasma membrane upregulation of CD38 and NAD+ glycohydrolase activity. Further investigation in relation to CD38 gene activation and B-CLL behavior remains to be defined.},

	Abstract = {CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein-alpha (C/EBP alpha) is a basic leucine zipper protein that controls transcription of genes important for liver function, white adipose tissue development, and granulocyte differentiation. In addition to its function in controlling gene expression in differentiated tissues, C/EBP alpha is also associated with an antimitotic activity. We have previously demonstrated that C/EBP alpha interacts with p21, a cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor, and that C/EBP alpha inhibits proliferation when expressed in several different cell types (Timchenko, N. A., Harris, T. E., Wilde, M., Bilyeu, T. A., Burgess-Beusse, B. L., Finegold, M. J., and Darlington, G. J. (1997) Mol. Cell. Biol. 17, 7353--7361). Here we define the regions of C/EBP alpha required for interaction with p21 and demonstrate that CDK2 also interacts with C/EBP alpha. We show that C/EBP alpha can cooperate with p21 to inhibit CDK2 activity in vitro. The effect of C/EBP alpha on CDK2 activity requires the p21 and CDK2 interaction sites within C/EBP alpha. C/EBP alpha mutants incapable of inhibiting CDK2 activity in vitro do not inhibit proliferation in cultured cells. However, C/EBP alpha mutants defective in DNA binding inhibit proliferation as effectively as the wild-type protein. These findings show that C/EBP alpha-mediated growth arrest occurs through protein interactions and is independent of its transcriptional activity.},

	Abstract = {Transcription factors from the CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) family play important roles in myeloid cell differentiation. CD14 is a monocyte/macrophage differentiation marker and is strongly up-regulated during monocytic cell differentiation. Here, we report the direct binding of C/EBP to the monocyte-specific promoter of CD14. Transactivation analyses demonstrate that C/EBP family members significantly activate the CD14 promoter. These data indicate that C/EBP is directly involved in the regulation of CD14 gene expression. When myelomonoblastic U937 cells are treated with vitamin D(3) and TGF-beta, they differentiate toward monocytic cells. Using specific antibodies against different C/EBP family members in electrophoretic mobility shift assays and Western blot assays, we have identified a specific increase in the DNA binding and the expression of C/EBPalpha and C/EBPbeta during U937 monocytic cell differentiation, and we found C/EBPalpha and C/EBPbeta bind to the promoter in heterodimer. Furthermore, with stably transfected cell lines, we demonstrate that the C/EBP binding site in the CD14 promoter plays a critical role for mediating TGF-beta signaling in the synergistic activation of CD14 expression by vitamin D(3) and TGF-beta during U937 differentiation. This may indicate that C/EBPs have important functions in the process of TGF-beta signal transduction during monocyte differentiation.},

Gene disruption in mice blocks early granulocyte differentiation and disruption of C/EBP alpha function has been implicated in human acute myeloid leukemia (AML), but no systematic structure-function analysis has been undertaken to identify the mechanisms involved in C/EBP alpha-mediated granulocyte differentiation. Here we demonstrate that loss of either of 2 key regions results in disruption of C/EBP alpha granulocytic development: the amino terminus and specific residues residing on the non-DNA binding face of the basic region. Mutation of either results in loss of C/EBP alpha inhibition of E2F and down-regulation of c-Myc, but only mutation of the basic region results in loss of physical interaction with E2F. In contrast, while the amino terminal mutant retains the ability to interact with E2F, this mutant fails to bind a C/EBP alpha site efficiently, fails to activate C/EBP alpha target genes, and is also defective in inhibition of E2F activity. These results further emphasize the importance of inhibition of proliferative pathways in granulopoiesis and demonstrate that several regions of the C/EBP alpha protein are involved in this mechanism.},

	Abstract = {Ectopic expression of CAAT/enhancer binding protein {\^I}$\pm$ (C/EBP{\^I}$\pm$) in p210BCR/ABL-expressing cells induces granulocytic differentiation, inhibits proliferation, and suppresses leukemogenesis. To dissect the molecular mechanisms underlying these biological effects, C/EBP{\^I}$\pm$-regulated genes were identified by microarray analysis in 32D-p210BCR/ABL cells. One of the genes whose expression was activated by C/EBP{\^I}$\pm$ in a DNA binding-dependent manner in BCR/ABL-expressing cells is the transcriptional repressor Gfi-1. We show here that C/EBP{\^I}$\pm$ interacts with a functional C/EBP binding site in the Gfi-1 5'-flanking region and enhances the promoter activity of Gfi-1. Moreover, in K562 cells, RNA interference-mediated downregulation of Gfi-1 expression partially rescued the proliferation-inhibitory but not the differentiation-inducing effect of C/EBP{\^I}$\pm$. Ectopic expression of wild-type Gfi-1, but not of a transcriptional repressor mutant (Gfi-1P2A), inhibited proliferation and markedly suppressed colony formation but did not induce granulocytic differentiation of BCR/ABL-expressing cells. By contrast, Gfi-1 short hairpin RNA-tranduced CD34(+) chronic myeloid leukemia cells were markedly more clonogenic than the scramble-transduced counterpart. Together, these studies indicate that Gfi-1 is a direct target of C/EBP{\^I}$\pm$ required for its proliferation and survival-inhibitory effects in BCR/ABL-expressing cells.},

	Abstract = {The human C/EBP alpha gene promoter shares significant sequence homology with that of the mouse but has a different mechanism of autoregulation. Activation of the murine promoter by direct binding of C/EBP alpha to a site within 200 bp of the transcriptional start was shown to elevate activity by approximately threefold (R. J. Christy, K. H. Kaestner, D. E. Geiman, and M. D. Lane, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 88:2593-2597, 1991; K. Legraverend, P. Antonson, P. Flodby, and K. G. Xanthapoulos, Nucleic Acids Res. 21:1735-1742, 1993). Unlike its murine counterpart, the human C/EBP alpha gene promoter does not contain a cis element that binds the C/EBP alpha protein. Neither C/EBP alpha nor C/EBP beta (NF-Il-6) binds the human C/EBP alpha promoter within 437 bp. However, cotransfection studies show that C/EBP alpha stimulates transcription of a reporter gene driven by 437 bp of the C/EBP alpha promoter. Our studies show that the human C/EBP alpha protein stimulates USF to bind to a USF consensus element within C/EBP alpha promoter and activates it by two- to threefold. We propose that the human gene employs the ubiquitously expressed DNA-binding protein factor USF to carry out autoregulation. Autoregulation of the human C/EBP alpha promoter was abolished by deletion of the USF binding site, CACGTG. Expression of human C/EBP beta following transfection did not stimulate USF binding. These studies suggest a mechanism whereby tissue-specific autoregulation can be achieved via a trans-acting factor that is expressed in all cell types. Thus, direct binding of the C/EBP alpha protein to the promoter of the C/EBP alpha gene is not required for autoregulation.},

	Abstract = {Hematopoietic transcription factors are essential for specifying cell fates; however, the function of cytokines in such developmental decisions is unresolved. We demonstrate here that haploinsufficiency for the gene encoding the transcription factor PU.1 partially suppresses the neutropenia of mice deficient in granulocyte colony-stimulating factor. This suppression was due to an increase in granulocytic progenitors and a diminution of monocytic progenitors. With (PU.1+/-) ES cells as well as (PU.1-/-) hematopoietic progenitors, we show that higher expression of PU.1 is needed for macrophage than for neutrophil development. In a (PU.1-/-) progenitor cell line, in which graded activity of PU.1 regulates neutrophil versus macrophage development, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor signaling supported the neutrophil cell fate by increasing expression of the neutrophil transcription factor C/EBPalpha in relation to expression of PU.1. Collectively, these results indicate that cytokines can promote cell fate decisions by altering the relative concentrations of lineage-determining transcriptional regulators.},

Langerhans cells (LCs) reside in epithelia in the steady state, whereas monocytes can provide dendritic cells (DCs) on demand in response to inflammatory signals. Both DC subset pathways arise from shared CD14+ monocyte precursors, which in turn develop from myeloid committed progenitor cells. However, the underlying hematopoietic mechanisms still remain poorly defined. Here, we demonstrate that the vitamin D(3) receptor (VDR) is induced by transforming growth factor beta1 during LC lineage commitment and exerts a positive role during LC generation. In contrast, VDR is repressed during interleukin-4 (IL-4)-dependent monocyte-derived DC (moDC) differentiation. We identified GATA-1 as a repressor of VDR. GATA-1 is induced by IL-4 in moDCs. Forced inducible expression of GATA-1 mimics IL-4 in redirecting moDC differentiation and vice versa, GATA-1 knockdown arrests moDC differentiation at the monocyte stage. Moreover, ectopic GATA-1 expression stabilizes the moDC phenotype under monocyte-promoting conditions in the presence of vitamin D3 (VD3). In summary, human myeloid DC subset differentiation is inversely regulated by GATA-1 and VDR. GATA-1 mediates the repression of VDR and enables IL-4-dependent moDC differentiation. Conversely, VDR is induced downstream of transforming growth factor beta1 and is functionally involved in promoting LC differentiation.},

	Abstract = {The myeloid-specific transcription factor PU.1 is essential for expression of p47(phox), a component of the superoxide-forming phagocyte NADPH oxidase. The consensus PU.1 binding sequence (GAGGAA) is located on the non-coding strand from position -40 to -45 relative to the transcriptional start site of the p47phox promoter. A promoter construct extending to -46 was sufficient to drive tissue-specific expression of the luciferase reporter gene, but extension of the promoter from -46 to -48 resulted in a significant increase in reporter expression. Mutations of the nucleotides G at -46 and/or T at -47 reduced both reporter expression and PU.1 binding, whereas mutations at -48 had no effect. The PU.1 binding avidity of these sequences correlated closely with their capacity to dictate reporter gene transcription. In parallel studies on the functional PU.1 site in the promoter of CD18, mutations of nucleotides G and T at positions -76 and -77 (corresponding to -46 and -47, respectively, of the p47phox promoter) reduced PU.1 binding and nearly abolished the contribution of this element to promoter activity. We conclude that the immediate flanking nucleotides of the PU.1 consensus motif have significant effects on PU.1 binding avidity and activity and that this region is the dominant cis element regulating p47phox expression.},

	Abstract = {PU.1 has previously been shown to be down-regulated in classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL) cells via promoter methylation. We performed bisulfite sequencing and proved that the promoter region and the -17 kb upstream regulatory element of the PU.1 gene were highly methylated. To evaluate whether down-regulation of PU.1 is essential for the growth of cHL cells, we conditionally expressed PU.1 in 2 cHL cell lines, L428 and KM-H2. Overexpression of PU.1 induced complete growth arrest and apoptosis in both cell lines. Furthermore, in a Hodgkin lymphoma tumor xenograft model using L428 and KM-H2 cell lines, overexpression of PU.1 led to tumor regression or stable disease. Lentiviral transduction of PU.1 into primary cHL cells also induced apoptosis. DNA microarray analysis revealed that among genes related to cell cycle and apoptosis, p21 (CDKN1A) was highly up-regulated in L428 cells after PU.1 induction. Stable knockdown of p21 rescued PU.1-induced growth arrest in L428 cells, suggesting that the growth arrest and apoptosis observed are at least partially dependent on p21 up-regulation. These data strongly suggest that PU.1 is a potent tumor suppressor in cHL and that induction of PU.1 with demethylation agents and/or histone deacetylase inhibitors is worth exploring as a possible therapeutic option for patients with cHL.},

Molecular mechanisms underlying the generation and refinement of these patterns during cell fate determination remain unexplored because of the absence of suitable experimental systems. Using PU.1(-/-) progenitors, we demonstrate that at subthreshold levels, this Ets transcription factor regulates a mixed pattern (macrophage/neutrophil) of gene expression within individual myeloid progenitors. Increased PU.1 levels refine the pattern and promote macrophage differentiation by modulating a novel regulatory circuit comprised of counter antagonistic repressors, Egr-1,2/Nab-2 and Gfi-1. Egr-1 and Egr-2 function redundantly to activate macrophage genes and to repress the neutrophil program. These results are used to assemble and mathematically model a gene regulatory network that exhibits both graded and bistable behaviors and accounts for the onset and resolution of mixed lineage patterns during cell fate determination.},

	Abstract = {Knockdown of the transcription factor PU.1 (encoded by Sfpi1) leads to acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in mice. We examined the transcriptome of preleukemic hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in which PU.1 was knocked down (referred to as 'PU.1-knockdown HSCs') to identify transcriptional changes preceding malignant transformation. Transcription factors c-Jun and JunB were among the top-downregulated targets. Restoration of c-Jun expression in preleukemic cells rescued the PU.1 knockdown-initiated myelomonocytic differentiation block. Lentiviral restoration of JunB at the leukemic stage led to loss of leukemic self-renewal capacity and prevented leukemia in NOD-SCID mice into which leukemic PU.1-knockdown cells were transplanted. Examination of human individuals with AML confirmed the correlation between PU.1 and JunB downregulation. These results delineate a transcriptional pattern that precedes leukemic transformation in PU.1-knockdown HSCs and demonstrate that decreased levels of c-Jun and JunB contribute to the development of PU.1 knockdown-induced AML by blocking differentiation and increasing self-renewal. Therefore, examination of disturbed gene expression in HSCs can identify genes whose dysregulation is essential for leukemic stem cell function and that are targets for therapeutic interventions.},

@article{Chen1995,
	Abstract = {PU.1 (Spi-1), a member of the Ets transcription factor family, is predominantly expressed in myeloid (granulocytes, monocytes and macrophages) and B cells. PU.1 is upregulated early during commitment of multipotential progenitors to the myeloid lineages and inhibition of PU.1 function in human CD34+ progenitors prior to this upregulation blocks myeloid colony formation. Since PU.1 expression appears to play a role in hematopoietic development, we characterized the PU.1 promoter. Here we report that the murine PU.1 promoter, as well as the human promoter, demonstrate tissue-specific reporter gene expression in myeloid cell lines but not in T cells and HeLa (non-hematopoietic cells) cells. Deletion analysis of the PU.1 promoter indicates that tissue-specific functional elements are encoded in the -61 to -39 bp and -7 to +34 bp regions. The first region contains a functional octamer (Oct) site at -54 bp and an Sp1 site at -39 bp. The second contains a binding site at +20 bp for both PU.1 itself and the related ets family member Spi-B. In vivo footprinting assays demonstrate that a hypersensitive band was detected at the PU.1 site in myeloid cells but not in HeLa. A mutation of the PU.1 site which abolished PU.1 binding caused a significant decrease in promoter activity. Mutation of the Oct and/or Sp1 site results in a lesser decrease of promoter activity in myeloid cells. Co-transfection of PU.1 or Spi-B in cells lacking PU.1 and Spi-B specifically transactivated a minimal promoter containing the PU.1 binding site, indicating that PU.1 can activate its own promoter elements in an autoregulatory loop. Positive autoregulation of the PU.1 promoter may play an important role in the function of PU.1 in myeloid cells.},

The ETS transcription factor PU.1 has a potent ability to confer macrophage phenotypes on cells already committed to a different lineage, but how it overcomes the presence of other master regulators is not known. The nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor {\^I}³ (PPAR{\^I}³) is the master regulator of the adipose lineage, and its genomic binding pattern in adipocytes is well characterized. Here we show that, when expressed at macrophage levels in mature adipocytes, PU.1 bound a large fraction of its macrophage sites, where it induced chromatin opening and the expression of macrophage target genes. Strikingly, PU.1 markedly reduced the genomic binding of PPAR{\^I}³ without changing its abundance. PU.1 expression repressed genes with nearby adipocyte-specific PPAR{\^I}³ binding sites, while a common macrophage-adipocyte gene expression program was retained. Together, these data reveal unexpected lability within the adipocyte PPAR{\^I}³ cistrome and show that, even in terminally differentiated cells, PU.1 can remodel the cistrome of another master regulator.},

	Abstract = {NO appears as an important determinant in auto and paracrine macrophage function. We hypothesized that NO switches monocyte/macrophage function from a pro- to an anti-inflammatory phenotype by activating anti-inflammatory properties of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)gamma. NO-releasing compounds (100 micro M S-nitrosoglutathione or 50 micro M spermine-NONOate) as well as inducible NO synthase induction provoked activation of PPARgamma. This was proven by EMSAs, with the notion that supershift analysis pointed to the involvement of PPARgamma. PCR analysis ruled out induction of PPARgamma mRNA as a result of NO supplementation. Reporter assays, with a construct containing a triple PPAR response element in front of a thymidine kinase minimal promoter driving the luciferase gene, were positive in response to NO delivery. DNA binding capacity as well as the transactivating capability of PPARgamma were attenuated by addition of the antioxidant N-acetyl-cysteine or in the presence of the NO scavenger 2-phenyl-4,4,5,6-tetramethyl-imidazoline-1-oxyl 3-oxide. Having established that NO but not lipophilic cyclic GMP analogs activated PPARgamma, we verified potential anti-inflammatory consequences. The oxidative burst of macrophages, evoked by phorbol ester, was attenuated in association with NO-elicited PPARgamma activation. A cause-effect relationship was demonstrated when PPAR response element decoy oligonucleotides, supplied in front of NO delivery, allowed to regain an oxidative response. PPARgamma-mediated down-regulation of p47 phagocyte oxidase, a component of the NAD(P)H oxidase system, was identified as one molecular mechanism causing inhibition of superoxide radical formation. We conclude that NO participates in controlling the pro- vs anti-inflammatory phenotype of macrophages by modulating PPARgamma.},

	Abstract = {PURPOSE: The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma), a ligand-dependent transcription factor belonging to the family of nuclear receptors, has been implicated in the regulation of cell growth and differentiation although the exact mechanism(s) of this activity has not been elucidated. In this study, we explored the role of PPARgamma signaling on the control of gene expression of the cycle-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 in human lung carcinoma cells.
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Using several human lung carcinoma cell lines (small and non-small carcinoma cells), we assayed for cell growth inhibition and apoptosis induction. We also assayed for p21 mRNA and protein expression by reverse transcription-PCR, real-time reverse transcription-PCR, and Western blot analysis. Nuclear protein binding activities to three response elements located in the p21 promoter [nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB, Sp1, and NF-interleukin 6 (IL6) CAAT/enhancer binding protein (C/EBP)] were measured by gel mobility shift assays. We used transient transfection assays with p21 promoter reporter gene constructs to determine the transcriptional regulation by PPARgamma ligands. Finally, by using p21 antisense oligonucleotides, we tested the link between PPARgamma activation and p21 signaling in cell growth inhibition assays and by Western blot analysis.
RESULTS: We showed that the PPARgamma ligands PGJ2 and ciglitazone inhibit the growth and induce the apoptosis of several human lung carcinoma cell lines, whereas the PPARalpha agonist WY14643 has little effect. Treatment of lung carcinoma cells with the PPARgamma ligands PGJ2, ciglitazone, troglizaone, and GW1929 elevated p21 mRNA and protein levels and reduced cyclin D1 mRNA levels. These results were supported by transient transfection assays, which indicated that PPARgamma ligands increased p21 gene promoter activity in human lung carcinoma cells. In addition, p21 antisense oligonucleotides inhibited PPARgamma ligand-induced p21 protein expression and significantly blocked lung carcinoma cell growth inhibition induced by PPARgamma ligands. Finally, electrophoresis mobility shift experiments demonstrated that PPARgamma ligands increased the nuclear binding activities of Sp1 and NF-IL6 (C/EBP), two transcription factors with regulatory elements in the promoter region of the p21 gene.
CONCLUSION: PPARgamma ligands inhibit human lung carcinoma cell growth and induce apoptosis by stimulating the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 and by reducing cyclin D1 gene expression. The induction of p21 gene expression by PPARgamma ligands may be mediated through increased Sp1- and NF-IL6 (C/EBP)-dependent transcriptional activation. These observations unveil a mechanism for p21 gene regulation in lung carcinoma that represents a potential target for therapy.},

	Abstract = {Nuclear hormone receptors have been shown to be important transcription factors for regulating lipid metabolism in myeloid cells and were also implicated in differentiation processes of the myeloid lineage and macrophages. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) seems to be a key component of lipid uptake by inducing the scavenger receptor CD36 that mediates oxidized low-density lipoprotein uptake in macrophages. Retinoic acid receptors, on the other hand, were also shown to play important roles in myeloid cell differentiation. In this study, we present evidence for a cross-talk between these two nuclear receptor pathways in myeloid cells. We show that expression level of PPARgamma increases with the degree of monocyte/macrophage commitment during maturation. Activation of PPARgamma leads to the increased expression of maturation markers (e.g., CD14, CD36). It is interesting that retinoid treatment potentiates PPARgamma's ability to induce transcription of its target genes. Retinoid-increased PPARgamma response is sufficient for enhancing lipid uptake. Our data, taken together, indicate that the expression level of PPARgamma increases during monocyte/macrophage development. PPARgamma activity can be enhanced by retinoids at least in part via increasing PPARgamma expression level. These observations can be exploited to enhance therapeutically beneficial PPAR responses in myeloid cells.},

We also demonstrate that PPAR{\^I}³ mediates insulin sensitization by enhancing NAADP production through upregulation of CD38, the only enzyme identified for NAADP synthesis. Insulin produced NAADP by both CD38-dependent and -independent pathways, whereas PPAR{\^I}³ produced NAADP by CD38-dependent pathway. Blocking the NAADP signaling pathway abrogated both insulin-stimulated and PPAR{\^I}³-induced GLUT4 and GLUT1 translocation, thereby inhibiting glucose uptake. CD38 knockout partially inhibited insulin-stimulated glucose uptake. However, CD38 knockout completely blocked PPAR{\^I}³-induced glucose uptake in adipocytes and PPAR{\^I}³-mediated amelioration of glucose tolerance in diabetic mice. These results demonstrated that the NAADP signaling pathway is a critical molecular target for PPAR{\^I}³-mediated insulin sensitization.},

Rat aortic smooth muscle cells (RASMCs) were exposed to {\"I}-6 lipids, linoleic acid (LA), or its oxidized form, 13-HPODE (OxLA) in the presence or absence of a PPAR{\^I}$\pm$ antagonist (MK886) or PPAR{\^I}³ antagonist (GW9662) or PPAR-specific siRNA.

We provide novel insights into the mechanism of action of {\"I}-6 lipids on Egr-1/PPAR interactions in vascular cells and their potential in altering vascular function.},

	Abstract = {PPAR gamma is an adipose-selective nuclear hormone receptor that plays a key role in the control of adipocyte differentiation. Previous studies indicated that activation of ectopically expressed PPAR gamma induces differentiation when cells have ceased growth because of confluence. We show here that ligand activation of PPAR gamma is sufficient to induce growth arrest in fibroblasts and SV40 large T-antigen transformed, adipogenic HIB1B cells. Cell cycle withdrawal is accompanied by a decrease in the DNA-binding and transcriptional activity of the E2F/DP complex, which is attributable to an increase in the phosphorylation of these proteins, especially DP-1. This effect is a consequence of decreased expression of the catalytic subunit of the serine-threonine phosphatase PP2A. These data suggest an important role for PP2A in the control of E2F/DP activity and a new mode of cell cycle control in differentiation.},

	Abstract = {Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a pleiotropic cytokine, whose plasma levels are elevated in inflammatory diseases such as atherosclerosis. We have previously reported that peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARalpha) ligands (fibrates) lower elevated plasma concentrations of IL-6 in patients with atherosclerosis and inhibit IL-1-stimulated IL-6 secretion by human aortic smooth muscle cells (SMC). Here, we show that aortic explants isolated from PPARalpha-null mice display an exacerbated response to inflammatory stimuli, such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS), as demonstrated by increased IL-6 secretion. Furthermore, fibrate treatment represses IL-6 mRNA levels in LPS-stimulated aortas of PPARalpha wild-type, but not of PPARalpha-null mice, demonstrating a role for PPARalpha in this fibrate action. In human aortic SMC, fibrates inhibit IL-1-induced IL-6 gene expression. Furthermore, activation of PPARalpha represses both c-Jun- and p65-induced transcription of the human IL-6 promoter. Transcriptional interference between PPARalpha and both c-Jun and p65 occurs reciprocally, since c-Jun and p65 also inhibit PPARalpha-mediated activation of a PPAR response element-driven promoter. This transcriptional interference occurs independent of the promoter context as demonstrated by cotransfection experiments using PPARalpha, p65, and c-Jun Gal4 chimeras. Overexpression of the transcriptional coactivator cAMP-responsive element-binding protein-binding protein (CBP) does not relieve PPARalpha-mediated transcriptional repression of p65 and c-Jun. Finally, glutathione S-transferase pull-down experiments demonstrate that PPARalpha physically interacts with c-Jun, p65, and CBP. Altogether these data indicate that fibrates inhibit the vascular inflammatory response via PPARalpha by interfering with the NF-kappaB and AP-1 transactivation capacity involving direct protein-protein interaction with p65 and c-Jun.},

	Abstract = {Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) gamma is activated by thiazolidinediones (TZDs), widely used as insulin-sensitizing agents for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. TZDs have been shown to induce apoptosis in a variety of mammalian cells. In vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs), proliferation and apoptosis may be competing processes during the formation of restenotic and atherosclerotic lesions. The precise molecular mechanisms by which TZDs induce apoptosis in VSMCs, however, remain unclear. In the present study, we demonstrate that the TZDs rosiglitazone (RSG), troglitazone (TRO), and a novel non-TZD partial PPARgamma agonist (nTZDpa) induce caspase-mediated apoptosis of human coronary VSMCs. Induction of VSMC apoptosis correlated closely with an upregulation of growth arrest and DNA damage-inducible gene 45 (GADD45) mRNA expression and transcription, a well-recognized modulator of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Using adenoviral-mediated overexpression of a constitutively active PPARgamma mutant and the irreversible PPARgamma antagonist GW9662, we provide evidence that PPARgamma ligands induce caspase-mediated apoptosis and GADD45 expression through a receptor-dependent pathway. Deletion analysis of the GADD45 promoter revealed that a 153-bp region between -234 and -81 bp proximal to the transcription start site, containing an Oct-1 element, was crucial for the PPARgamma ligand-mediated induction of the GADD45 promoter. PPARgamma activation induced Oct-1 protein expression and DNA binding and stimulated activity of a reporter plasmid driven by multiple Oct-1 elements. These findings suggest that activation of PPARgamma can lead to apoptosis and growth arrest in VSMCs, at least in part, by inducing Oct-1-mediated transcription of GADD45.

	Abstract = {The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) is a ligand-activated transcription factor that has been implicated in the induction of differentiation of various cell types, including human uroepithelial cells. PPARgamma-mediated differentiation of normal human urothelial (NHU) cells in vitro requires coinhibition of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signalling and is characterised by de novo expression of late/terminal differentiation-associated genes, including uroplakins (UPK), over a 6-day period. We used gene microarrays to identify intermediary transcription factors induced in direct response to PPARgamma activation of EGFR-inhibited NHU cells. FOXA1 and IRF-1 contained consensus cognate binding sites in UPK1a, UPK2, and UPK3a promoters and transcripts were induced within 12 h of PPARgamma activation; transcription complex formation was confirmed by electromobility shift assays. In urothelium in situ, both FOXA1 and IRF-1 were nuclear and expressed in a differentiation-associated pattern. Knockdown by transient siRNA of either FOXA1 or IRF-1 abrogated PPARgamma-induced uroplakin expression in vitro. This is the first evidence that ligand activation of PPARgamma induces expression of intermediary transcription factors that mediate an epithelial differentiation programme and represents a new paradigm for understanding differentiation, regenerative repair and inflammation in epithelial tissues.},

Questions remain about whether these factors operate independently in separate, parallel pathways of differentiation, or whether a single pathway exists. PPARgamma can promote adipogenesis in C/EBPalpha-deficient cells, but the converse has not been tested. We have created an immortalized line of fibroblasts lacking PPARgamma, which we use to show that C/EBPalpha has no ability to promote adipogenesis in the absence of PPARgamma. These results indicate that C/EBPalpha and PPARgamma participate in a single pathway of fat cell development with PPARgamma being the proximal effector of adipogenesis.},

	Abstract = {The hormonal form of vitamin D, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, acting through its cognate nuclear receptor (vitamin D3 receptor, VDR) will induce myeloid leukemic cell lines to terminally differentiate into monocytes/macrophages. Because VDR acts by transcriptionally regulating responsive genes in a ligand-dependent manner, we sought target genes of the receptor that initiate, the differentiation process in response to ligand. We screened a cDNA library prepared from the myelomonocytic U937 cell line with probes generated from either 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3-treated or untreated cells. We report here that a candidate clone that hybridized differentially is the Cdk inhibitor p21WAF1, CIP1. Furthermore, we show that p21 is transcriptionally induced by 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 in a VDR-dependent, but not p53-dependent, manner, and we identify a functional vitamin D response element in the p21 promoter. Transient overexpression of p21 and/or the related Cdk inhibitor p27 in U937 cells in the absence of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 results in the cell-surface expression of monocyte/macrophage-specific markers, suggesting that ligand-modulated transcriptional induction of the p21 gene facilitates the induced differentiation of this monoblastic cell line. We believe that this is the first report demonstrating that the ectopic overexpression of a Cdk inhibitor such as p21 or p27 directly leads to a terminal differentiation program.},

	Abstract = {Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) delta is the most widely expressed member of the PPAR family of nuclear receptor fatty acid sensors. Real-time PCR analysis of breast and prostate cancer cell lines demonstrated that PPARdelta expression was increased 1.5 to 3.2-fold after three hours stimulation with the natural vitamin D receptor (VDR) agonist, 1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1alpha,25(OH)2D3). In silico analysis of the 20 kb of the human PPARdelta promoter revealed a DR3-type 1alpha,25(OH)2D3 response element approximately 350 bp upstream of the transcription start site, which was able to bind VDR-retinoid X receptor (RXR) heterodimers and mediate a 1alpha,25(OH)2D3-dependent upregulation of reporter gene activity. Chromatin immuno-precipitation assays demonstrated that a number of proteins representative for 1alpha,25(OH)2D3-mediated gene activation, such as VDR, RXR and RNA polymerase II, displayed a 1alpha,25(OH)2D3-dependent association with a region of the proximal PPARdelta promoter that contained the putative DR3-type VDRE. This was also true for other proteins that are involved in or are the subject of chromatin modification, such as the histone acetyltransferase CBP and histone 4, which displayed ligand-dependent association and acetylation, respectively. Finally, real-time PCR analysis demonstrated that 1alpha,25(OH)2D3 and the synthetic PPARdelta ligand L783483 show a cell and time-dependent interference in each other's effects on VDR mRNA expression, so that their combined application shows complex effects on the induction of VDR target genes, such as CYP24. Taken together, we conclude that PPARdelta is a primary 1alpha,25(OH)2D3-responding gene and that VDR and PPARdelta signaling pathways are interconnected at the level of cross-regulation of their respective transcription factor mRNA levels.},

	Abstract = {Over the last quarter century, more than 532 genes have been put forward as regulatory targets of retinoic acid. In some cases this control is direct, driven by a liganded heterodimer of retinoid receptors bound to a DNA response element; in others, it is indirect, reflecting the actions of intermediate transcription factors, non-classical associations of receptors with other proteins, or even more distant mechanisms. Given the broad range of scientific questions continually under investigation, researchers do not always have occasion to classify target genes along these lines. However, our understanding of the genetic role of retinoids will be enhanced if such a distinction can be made for each regulated gene. We have therefore evaluated published data from 1,191 papers covering 532 genes and have classified these genes into four categories according to the degree to which an hypothesis of direct versus indirect control is supported overall. We found 27 genes that are unquestionably direct targets of the classical pathway in permissive cellular contexts (Category 3 genes), plus 105 genes that appear to be candidates, pending the results of specific additional experiments (Category 2). Data on another 267 targets are not evocative of direct or indirect regulation either way, although control by retinoic acid through some mechanism is clear (Category 1). Most of the remaining 133 targets seem to be regulated indirectly, usually through a transcriptional intermediary, in the contexts studied so far (Category 0).},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) ligand 6-Formylindolo(3,2-b)carbazole (FICZ) has received increasing attention since its identification as an endogenous AhR ligand and a photoproduct of tryptophan. FICZ and its metabolites have been detected in human fluids. We recently reported that AhR promotes retinoic acid (RA)-induced granulocytic differentiation of HL-60 myeloblastic leukemia cells by restricting the nuclear abundance of the stem cell associated transcription factor Oct4. The standard clinical management of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) is differentiation induction therapy using RA. But RA is not effective for other myeloid leukemias, making the mechanism of RA-induced differentiation observed in a non-APL myeloid leukemia of interest. To our knowledge, this is the first study regarding the influence of FICZ on RA-induced differentiation in any type of leukemic blasts.
METHODS: Using flow cytometry and Western blotting assays, we determined the effects of FICZ on RA-induced differentiation of HL-60 human leukemia cells. All experiments were performed in triplicate. The groups RA and FICZ{\^a}+{\^a}RA were compared using the Paired-Samples T-Test. Western blot figures present the typical blots.
RESULTS: We demonstrate that FICZ enhances RA-induced differentiation, assessed by the expression of the membrane differentiation marker CD11b; cell cycle arrest; and the functional differentiation marker, inducible-oxidative metabolism. FICZ causes changes in signaling events that are known to drive differentiation, and notably augments the RA-induced sustained activation of the RAF/MEK/ERK axis of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade. FICZ also augments expression of the known MAPK signaling regulatory molecules c-Cbl, VAV1, pY458 p85 PI3K, Src-family kinases (SFKs), and IRF-1, a transcription factor associated with this putative signalsome that promotes RA-induced differentiation. Moreover, FICZ in combination with RA also increases expression of AhR and even more so of both Cyp1A2 and p47phox, which are known to be transcriptionally regulated by AhR. pY1021 PDGFR{\^I}², a marker associated with retinoic acid syndrome was also increased.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that FICZ modulates intracellular signaling pathways and enhances RA-induced differentiation.},

	Abstract = {We reported previously that the induced differentiation of the myelomonocytic cell line U937 by vitamin D3 is facilitated by the transcriptional induction of the p21(WAF1/CIP1) gene by the vitamin D3 receptor (Liu, M., Lee, M.-H., Cohen, M., and Freedman, L. P. (1996) Genes Dev. 10, 143-153). Retinoic acid (RA), a physiological metabolite of vitamin A, is also a potent inducer of differentiation of several cell types, including myeloid leukemic cells. Like vitamin D3, RA acts through a subfamily of nuclear hormone receptors, RARs and RXRs (retinoid X receptors), which regulate the expression of target genes by binding to specific DNA elements and modulating transcription initiation. In this report we demonstrate that the gene encoding p21 is also a RA-responsive target gene, and we describe a functional RA response element in this gene's promoter which is required to confer RA induction through RAR.RXR heterodimers. These results correlate the RA induction of monocytic differentiation of U937 cells with the transcriptional activation of the p21 gene and suggest a role for this cyclin/cyclin-dependent kinase complex inhibitor in facilitating this differentiation pathway.},

	Abstract = {CD38 is a leukocyte differentiation antigen that has been thought to be a phenotypic marker of different subpopulations of T- and B-lymphocytes. In myeloid cells, CD38 is expressed during early stages of differentiation. Virtually no information is available on regulation and functions of CD38. Recently we reported that all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) is a potent and highly specific inducer of CD38 expression in human promyelocytic leukemia cells. Here we report that ATRA-induced expression of CD38 antigen in myeloid cells is mediated through retinoic acid-alpha receptor (RAR alpha). ATRA failed to induce CD38 expression in a mutant subclone of the HL-60 myeloid leukemia cell line (designated HL-60R) that is relatively resistant to ATRA-induced granulocytic differentiation. Retroviral vector-mediated transduction of RA receptor (RAR alpha) into this HL-60R subclone completely restored the sensitivity of these cells to ATRA in terms of their ability to express CD38. In contrast, CD38 expression was not inducible by ATRA in HL-60R cells, transfected with a functional RAR beta, RAR gamma, or RXR alpha receptor. Induction of CD38 in acute promyelocytic and acute myeloblastic leukemia cells was independent of ATRA-induced cytodifferentiation. Following culture with ATRA, increased CD38 protein levels were also observed in normal CD34+ bone marrow cells, but not on normal circulating granulocytes. From these results, we conclude that CD38 is ATRA inducible in myeloid leukemia cells and normal CD34+ bone marrow cells. This effect is independent of differentiation and is mediated by RAR alpha in HL-60 cells, suggesting a similar role for RAR alpha in CD38 expression in other hematopoietic cells.},

	Abstract = {To unravel the network of transcription factors established during development it is important to understand how genes specifically expressed during embryogenesis are regulated. Oct-4 is a transcription factor whose expression is associated with an undifferentiated cell phenotype in the early mouse embryo and is downregulated when such cells differentiate. An enhancer in the upstream region of Oct-4 has previously been reported as being sufficient to mediate the cell-type specific expression and RA-dependent down-regulation in EC cells, although the enhancer contains no retinoic acid receptor (RAR) binding sites. Here we report the identification of promoter elements important for the regulation of the Oct-4 gene in EC cells. A region of the proximal Oct-4 promoter contains an overlapping set of regulatory elements including a high affinity binding site for Sp1 and three direct repeats of an AGGTCA-like sequence with either +1 or 0 spacing. Binding and transient transfection assays reveal that Oct-4 is subject to negative regulation by different members of the steroid-thyroid hormone receptor superfamily. Specifically, important roles for ARP-1 and RAR in Oct-4 expression are indicated.},

	Abstract = {Interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1), a transcription factor and tumor suppressor involved in cell growth regulation and immune responses, has been shown to be induced by all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA). However, the factors controlling the cellular location and activity of IRF-1 are not well understood. In this study, we examined the expression of IRF-1 and its nuclear localization, DNA-binding activity, and target gene expression in human mammary epithelial MCF10A cells, a model of breast epithelial cell differentiation and carcinogenesis. Following initial treatment with ATRA, IRF-1 mRNA and protein were induced within 2 hrs, reached a peak (>30-fold induction) at 8 hrs, and declined afterwards. IRF-1 protein was predominantly cytoplasmic during this treatment. Although a second dose of ATRA or Am580 (a related retinoid selective for retinoic acid receptor-alpha [RARalpha]), given 16 hrs after the first dose, restimulated IRF-1 mRNA and protein levels to a similar level to that obtained by the first dose, IRF-1 was predominantly concentrated in the nucleus after restimulation. ATRA and Am580 also increased nuclear RARalpha, whereas retinoid X receptor-alpha (RXRalpha)--a dimerization partner for RARalpha, was localized to the nucleus upon second exposure to ATRA. However, ATRA and Am580 did not regulate the expression or activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription-1 (STAT-1), a transcription factor capable of inducing the expression of IRF-1, indicating an STAT-1-independent mechanism of regulation by ATRA and Am580. The increase in nuclear IRF-1 after retinoid restimulation was accompanied by enhanced binding to an IRF-E DNA response element, and elevated expression of an IRF-1 target gene, 2',5'-oligoadenylate synthetase-2. The dual effect of retinoids in increasing IRF-1 mRNA and protein and in augmenting the nuclear localization of IRF-1 protein may be essential for maximizing the tumor suppressor activity and the immunosurveillance functions of IRF-1 in breast epithelial cells.},

@article{Friedman2007,
	Abstract = {PU.1 directs the hematopoietic stem cell to the lymphoid-myeloid progenitor (LMP) and interacts with GATA-binding protein 1 to inhibit commitment to the megakaryocyte-erythroid progenitor. The CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP)alpha then directs the LMP to the granulocyte-monocyte progenitor (GMP) stage, while inhibiting lymphoid development via cross-inhibition of Pax5 and potentially other regulators. Increased PU.1 activity favors monocytic commitment of the GMP. Induction of PU.1 by C/EBPalpha and interaction of PU.1 with c-Jun elevates PU.1 activity. Zippering of C/EBPalpha with c-Jun or c-Fos also contributes to monocyte lineage specification. An additional factor, potentially an Id1-regulated basic helix-loop-helix protein, may be required for the GMP to commit to the granulocyte lineage. Egr-1, Egr-2, Vitamin D Receptor, MafB/c: Fos and PU.1:interferon regulatory factor 8 complexes direct further monocytic maturation, while retinoic acid receptor (RAR) and C/EBPepsilon direct granulopoiesis. Both C/EBPalpha and RARs induce C/EBPepsilon, and PU.1 is also required, albeit at lower levels, for granulocytic maturation. HoxA10 and CAAT displacement protein act as transcriptional repressors to delay expression of terminal differentiation. Gfi-1 and Egr-1,2/Nab2 complexes repress each other to maintain myeloid lineage fidelity. NF-kappaB directly binds and cooperates with C/EBPbeta to induce the inflammatory response in mature myeloid cells and potentially also cooperates with C/EBPalpha to regulate early myelopoiesis.},

	Abstract = {Tightly regulated expression of the transcription factor PU.1 is crucial for normal hematopoiesis. PU.1 knockdown mice develop acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and PU.1 mutations have been observed in some populations of patients with AML. Here we found that conditional expression of promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha (PML-RARA), the protein encoded by the t(15;17) translocation found in acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), suppressed PU.1 expression, while treatment of APL cell lines and primary cells with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) restored PU.1 expression and induced neutrophil differentiation. ATRA-induced activation was mediated by a region in the PU.1 promoter to which CEBPB and OCT-1 binding were induced. Finally, conditional expression of PU.1 in human APL cells was sufficient to trigger neutrophil differentiation, whereas reduction of PU.1 by small interfering RNA (siRNA) blocked ATRA-induced neutrophil differentiation. This is the first report to show that PU.1 is suppressed in acute promyelocytic leukemia, and that ATRA restores PU.1 expression in cells harboring t(15;17).},

	Abstract = {Estradiol-mediated enhancement of retinoic acid receptor alpha (RARalpha) expression in the estrogen receptor (ER)-positive human breast carcinoma (HBC) cells results in their sensitivity to RA-mediated growth inhibition (A. K. Rishi et al., Cancer Res., 55: 4999-5006, 1995). Most ER-negative HBCs are known to express lower levels of RARalpha and are resistant to RA-mediated inhibition of growth. We show that ER-negative SKBR-3 and MDA-MB-435 HBCs express approximately 2-fold higher levels of RARalpha isoform 1 mRNA when compared to the ER-negative MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 HBCs. SKBR-3 cells are sensitive to growth inhibition by RA, and by using RARalpha-selective synthetic retinoids, we demonstrate that the antiproliferative effects of RA in the SKBR-3 cell line are accomplished, in part, via activation of RARalpha. Both MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 HBCs are not growth inhibited by RA or any of the retinoids tested. Transient transfection experiments using a 5.0-kb RARalpha promoter fragment fused to the luciferase reporter gene showed 2-3-fold higher transcriptional activation in SKBR-3 cells when compared to MDA-MB-468 cells. We report identification of a 72-bp fragment of RARalpha promoter that contains unique cis elements responsible for mediating an estradiol-independent 2.5-fold enhancement of RARalpha gene expression in SKBR-3 and MDA-MB-435 cells.},
