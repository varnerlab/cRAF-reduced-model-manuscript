	Abstract = {The multivariate nature of cancer necessitates multi-targeted therapy, and kinase inhibitors account for a vast majority of approved cancer therapeutics. While acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) patients are highly responsive to retinoic acid (RA) therapy, kinase inhibitors have been gaining momentum as co-treatments with RA for non-APL acute myeloid leukemia (AML) differentiation therapies, especially as a means to treat relapsed or refractory AML patients. In this study GW5074 (a c-Raf inhibitor) and PP2 (a Src-family kinase inhibitor) enhanced RA-induced maturation of t(15;17)-negative myeloblastic leukemia cells and rescued response in RA-resistant cells. PD98059 (a MEK inhibitor) and Akti-1/2 (an Akt inhibitor) were less effective, but did tend to promote maturation-uncoupled G1/G0 arrest, while wortmannin (a PI3K inhibitor) did not enhance differentiation surface marker expression or growth arrest. PD98059 and Akti-1/2 did not enhance differentiation markers and have potential, antagonistic off-targets effects on the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), but neither could the AhR agonist 6-formylindolo(3,2-b)carbazole (FICZ) rescue differentiation events in the RA-resistant cells. GW5074 rescued early CD38 expression in RA-resistant cells exhibiting an early block in differentiation before CD38 expression, while for RA-resistant cells with differentiation blocked later, PP2 rescued the later differentiation marker CD11b; but surprisingly, the combination of the two was not synergistic. Kinases c-Raf, Src-family kinases Lyn and Fgr, and PI3K display highly correlated signaling changes during RA treatment, while activation of traditional downstream targets (Akt, MEK/ERK), and even the surface marker CD38, were poorly correlated with c-Raf or Lyn during differentiation. This suggests that an interrelated kinase module involving c-Raf, PI3K, Lyn and perhaps Fgr functions in a nontraditional way during RA-induced maturation or during rescue of RA induction therapy using inhibitor co-treatment in RA-resistant leukemia cells.},

	Abstract = {Retinoic acid is an embryonic morphogen and dietary factor that demonstrates chemotherapeutic efficacy in inducing maturation in leukemia cells. Using HL60 model human myeloid leukemia cells, where all-trans retinoic acid (RA) induces granulocytic differentiation, we developed two emergent RA-resistant HL60 cell lines which are characterized by loss of RA-inducible G1/G0 arrest, CD11b expression, inducible oxidative metabolism and p47(phox) expression. However, RA-treated RA-resistant HL60 continue to exhibit sustained MEK/ERK activation, and one of the two sequentially emergent resistant lines retains RA-inducible CD38 expression. Other signaling events that define the wild-type (WT) response are compromised, including c-Raf phosphorylation and increased expression of c-Cbl, Vav1, and the Src-family kinases (SFKs) Lyn and Fgr. As shown previously in WT HL60 cells, we found that the SFK inhibitor PP2 significantly increases G1/G0 cell cycle arrest, CD38 and CD11b expression, c-Raf phosphorylation and expression of the aforementioned regulators in RA-resistant HL60. The resistant cells were potentially incapable of developing inducible oxidative metabolism. These results motivate the concept that RA resistance can occur in steps, wherein growth arrest and other differentiation events may be recovered in both emergent lines. Investigating the mechanistic anomalies in resistant cell lines is of therapeutic significance and helps to mechanistically understand the response to retinoic acid's biological effects in WT HL60 cells.},

	Abstract = {Emergent resistance can be progressive and driven by global signaling aberrations. All-trans retinoic acid (RA) is the standard therapeutic agent for acute promyelocytic leukemia, but 10-20% of patients are not responsive, and initially responsive patients relapse and develop retinoic acid resistance. The patient-derived, lineage-bipotent acute myeloblastic leukemia (FAB M2) HL-60 cell line is a potent tool for characterizing differentiation-induction therapy responsiveness and resistance in t(15;17)-negative cells. Wild-type (WT) HL-60 cells undergo RA-induced granulocytic differentiation, or monocytic differentiation in response to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (D3). Two sequentially emergent RA-resistant HL-60 cell lines, R38+ and R38-, distinguishable by RA-inducible CD38 expression, do not arrest in G1/G0 and fail to upregulate CD11b and the myeloid-associated signaling factors Vav1, c-Cbl, Lyn, Fgr, and c-Raf after RA treatment. Here, we show that the R38+ and R38- HL-60 cell lines display a progressive reduced response to D3-induced differentiation therapy. Exploiting the biphasic dynamic of induced HL-60 differentiation, we examined if resistance-related defects occurred during the first 24 h (the early or "precommitment" phase) or subsequently (the late or "lineage-commitment" phase). HL-60 were treated with RA or D3 for 24 h, washed and retreated with either the same, different, or no differentiation agent. Using flow cytometry, D3 was able to induce CD38, CD11b and CD14 expression, and G1/G0 arrest when present during the lineage-commitment stage in R38+ cells, and to a lesser degree in R38- cells. Clustering analysis of cytometry and quantified Western blot data indicated that WT, R38+ and R38- HL-60 cells exhibited decreasing correlation between phenotypic markers and signaling factor expression. Thus differentiation induction therapy resistance can develop in stages, with initial partial RA resistance and moderate vitamin D3 responsiveness (unilineage maturation block), followed by bilineage maturation block and progressive signaling defects, notably the reduced expression of Vav1, Fgr, and c-Raf.},

	Abstract = {The covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy (CMA-ES) is one of the most powerful evolutionary algorithms for real-valued single-objective optimization. In this paper, we develop a variant of the CMA-ES for multi-objective optimization (MOO). We first introduce a single-objective, elitist CMA-ES using plus-selection and step size control based on a success rule. This algorithm is compared to the standard CMA-ES. The elitist CMA-ES turns out to be slightly faster on unimodal functions, but is more prone to getting stuck in sub-optimal local minima. In the new multi-objective CMAES (MO-CMA-ES) a population of individuals that adapt their search strategy as in the elitist CMA-ES is maintained. These are subject to multi-objective selection. The selection is based on non-dominated sorting using either the crowding-distance or the contributing hypervolume as second sorting criterion. Both the elitist single-objective CMA-ES and the MO-CMA-ES inherit important invariance properties, in particular invariance against rotation of the search space, from the original CMA-ES. The benefits of the new MO-CMA-ES in comparison to the well-known NSGA-II and to NSDE, a multi-objective differential evolution algorithm, are experimentally shown.},

	Abstract = {Genetic programs function to integrate environmental sensors, implement signal processing algorithms and control expression dynamics. These programs consist of integrated genetic circuits that individually implement operations ranging from digital logic to dynamic circuits, and they have been used in various cellular engineering applications, including the implementation of process control in metabolic networks and the coordination of spatial differentiation in artificial tissues. A key limitation is that the circuits are based on biochemical interactions occurring in the confined volume of the cell, so the size of programs has been limited to a few circuits. Here we apply part mining and directed evolution to build a set of transcriptional AND gates in Escherichia coli. Each AND gate integrates two promoter inputs and controls one promoter output. This allows the gates to be layered by having the output promoter of an upstream circuit serve as the input promoter for a downstream circuit. Each gate consists of a transcription factor that requires a second chaperone protein to activate the output promoter. Multiple activator-chaperone pairs are identified from type III secretion pathways in different strains of bacteria. Directed evolution is applied to increase the dynamic range and orthogonality of the circuits. These gates are connected in different permutations to form programs, the largest of which is a 4-input AND gate that consists of 3 circuits that integrate 4 inducible systems, thus requiring 11 regulatory proteins. Measuring the performance of individual gates is sufficient to capture the behaviour of the complete program. Errors in the output due to delays (faults), a common problem for layered circuits, are not observed. This work demonstrates the successful layering of orthogonal logic gates, a design strategy that could enable the construction of large, integrated circuits in single cells.},

	Abstract = {The proteome of any system is a dynamic entity, such that the intracellular concentration of a protein is dictated by the relative rates of synthesis and degradation. In this work, we have analyzed time-dependent changes in the incorporation of a stable amino acid resolved precursor, a protocol we refer to as "dynamic SILAC", using 1-D gel separation followed by in-gel digestion and LC-MS/MS analyses to profile the intracellular stability of almost 600 proteins from human A549 adenocarcinoma cells, requiring multiple measures of the extent of labeling with stable isotope labeled amino acids in a classic label-chase experiment. As turnover rates are acquired, a profile can be built up that allows exploration of the 'dynamic proteome' and of putative features that predispose a protein to a high or a low rate of turnover. Moreover, measurement of the turnover rate of individual components of supramolecular complexes provides a unique insight in processes of protein complex assembly and turnover.},

@article{Yang:2003aa,
	Abstract = {Although mRNA decay rates are a key determinant of the steady-state concentration for any given mRNA species, relatively little is known, on a population level, about what factors influence turnover rates and how these rates are integrated into cellular decisions. We decided to measure mRNA decay rates in two human cell lines with high-density oligonucleotide arrays that enable the measurement of decay rates simultaneously for thousands of mRNA species. Using existing annotation and the Gene Ontology hierarchy of biological processes, we assign mRNAs to functional classes at various levels of resolution and compare the decay rate statistics between these classes. The results show statistically significant organizational principles in the variation of decay rates among functional classes. In particular, transcription factor mRNAs have increased average decay rates compared with other transcripts and are enriched in "fast-decaying" mRNAs with half-lives <2 h. In contrast, we find that mRNAs for biosynthetic proteins have decreased average decay rates and are deficient in fast-decaying mRNAs. Our analysis of data from a previously published study of Saccharomyces cerevisiae mRNA decay shows the same functional organization of decay rates, implying that it is a general organizational scheme for eukaryotes. Additionally, we investigated the dependence of decay rates on sequence composition, that is, the presence or absence of short mRNA motifs in various regions of the mRNA transcript. Our analysis recovers the positive correlation of mRNA decay with known AU-rich mRNA motifs, but we also uncover further short mRNA motifs that show statistically significant correlation with decay. However, we also note that none of these motifs are strong predictors of mRNA decay rate, indicating that the regulation of mRNA decay is more complex and may involve the cooperative binding of several RNA-binding proteins at different sites.},

@article{Bostrom:1986aa,
	Abstract = {The synthesis and secretion of apolipoprotein B-100 (apoB-100) have been studied in a human hepatoma cell line, the Hep G2 cells. The time needed for the synthesis of apoB-100 was estimated to be 14 min, which corresponds to a translation rate of approximately 6 amino acids/s. ApoB-100 was compared with albumin and alpha 2-macroglobulin as to the distribution between the membrane and the luminal content in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the Golgi apparatus. The results suggested that apoB-100 approximately followed the distribution of these secretory proteins in the Golgi, while the ratios between the percent membrane-bound apoB-100 and percent membrane-bound albumin or alpha 2-macroglobulin were 3-4:1 in the ER. This may suggest that apoB-100 occurs in a membrane-associated form in ER prior to the integration in the lipoproteins. Pulse-chase studies combined with subcellular fractionation was used to investigate the kinetics for the intracellular transfer of apoB-100. A 3-min pulse of [35S]methionine was followed by an increase in apoB-100 radioactivity in the ER during the first 10-15 min of chase. The following 10-15 min of chase were characterized by linear decrease in apoB-100 radioactivity with a decay rate of approximately 6%/min. The residence kinetics for apoB-100 in the ER differed from that of transferrin and probably also from that of albumin. By comparing the time for the pulse maximum in ER with that in the denser Golgi fractions the time needed for the transfer between ER and Golgi could be estimated to be 10 min. The time needed for the secretion of newly synthesized apoB-100 was estimated to be 30 min. This indicates that the transfer of the protein through the Golgi apparatus to the extracellular space requires 20 min.},

	Abstract = {The control of RNA synthesis from protein-coding genes is fundamental in determining the various cell types of higher eukaryotes. The activation of these genes is driven by promoter complexes, and RNA synthesis is performed by an enzyme mega-complex-the RNA polymerase II holoenzyme. These two complexes are the fundamental components required to initiate gene expression and generate the primary transcripts that, after processing, yield mRNAs that pass to the cytoplasm where protein synthesis occurs. But although this gene expression pathway has been studied intensively, aspects of RNA metabolism remain difficult to comprehend. In particular, it is unclear why >95% of RNA polymerized by polymerase II remains in the nucleus, where it is recycled. To explain this apparent paradox, this review presents a detailed description of nuclear RNA (nRNA) metabolism in mammalian cells. We evaluate the number of active transcription units, discuss the distribution of polymerases on active genes, and assess the efficiency with which the products mature and pass to the cytoplasm. Differences between the behavior of mRNAs on this productive pathway and primary transcripts that never leave the nucleus lead us to propose that these represent distinct populations. We discuss possible roles for nonproductive RNAs and present a model to describe the metabolism of these RNAs in the nuclei of mammalian cells.-Jackson, D. A., Pombo, A., Iborra, F.

	Abstract = {Atomic force microscopy (AFM) has become an important tool for quantifying mechanical properties of biological materials ranging from single molecules to cells and tissues. Current AFM techniques for measuring elastic and viscoelastic properties of whole cells are based on indentation of cells firmly adhered to a substrate, but these techniques are not appropriate for probing nonadherent cells, such as passive human leukocytes, due to a lateral instability of the cells under load. Here we present a method for characterizing nonadherent cells with AFM by mechanically immobilizing them in microfabricated wells. We apply this technique to compare the deformability of human myeloid and lymphoid leukemia cells and neutrophils at low deformation rates, and we find that the cells are well described by an elastic model based on Hertzian mechanics. Myeloid (HL60) cells were measured to be a factor of 18 times stiffer than lymphoid (Jurkat) cells and six times stiffer than human neutrophils on average (E(infinity) = 855 +/- 670 Pa for HL60 cells, E(infinity) = 48 +/- 35 Pa for Jurkat cells, E(infinity) = 156 +/- 87 for neutrophils, mean +/- SD). This work demonstrates a simple method for extending AFM mechanical property measurements to nonadherent cells and characterizes properties of human leukemia cells that may contribute to leukostasis, a complication associated with acute leukemia.},

@article{Zhao:2014aa,
	Abstract = {Superresolution microscopy based on single-molecule centroid determination has been widely applied to cellular imaging in recent years. However, quantitative imaging of the mammalian nucleus has been challenging due to the lack of 3D optical sectioning methods for normal-sized cells, as well as the inability to accurately count the absolute copy numbers of biomolecules in highly dense structures. Here we report a reflected light-sheet superresolution microscopy method capable of imaging inside the mammalian nucleus with superior signal-to-background ratio as well as molecular counting with single-copy accuracy. Using reflected light-sheet superresolution microscopy, we probed the spatial organization of transcription by RNA polymerase II (RNAP II) molecules and quantified their global extent of clustering inside the mammalian nucleus. Spatiotemporal clustering analysis that leverages on the blinking photophysics of specific organic dyes showed that the majority (>70%) of the transcription foci originate from single RNAP II molecules, and no significant clustering between RNAP II molecules was detected within the length scale of the reported diameter of "transcription factories." Colocalization measurements of RNAP II molecules equally labeled by two spectrally distinct dyes confirmed the primarily unclustered distribution, arguing against a prevalent existence of transcription factories in the mammalian nucleus as previously proposed. The methods developed in our study pave the way for quantitative mapping and stoichiometric characterization of key biomolecular species deep inside mammalian cells.},

	Abstract = {We imaged transcription in living cells using a locus-specific reporter system, which allowed precise, single-cell kinetic measurements of promoter binding, initiation and elongation. Photobleaching of fluorescent RNA polymerase II revealed several kinetically distinct populations of the enzyme interacting with a specific gene. Photobleaching and photoactivation of fluorescent MS2 proteins used to label nascent messenger RNAs provided sensitive elongation measurements. A mechanistic kinetic model that fits our data was validated using specific inhibitors. Polymerases elongated at 4.3 kilobases min(-1), much faster than previously documented, and entered a paused state for unexpectedly long times. Transcription onset was inefficient, with only 1% of polymerase-gene interactions leading to completion of an mRNA. Our systems approach, quantifying both polymerase and mRNA kinetics on a defined DNA template in vivo with high temporal resolution, opens new avenues for studying regulation of transcriptional processes in vivo.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) ligand 6-Formylindolo(3,2-b)carbazole (FICZ) has received increasing attention since its identification as an endogenous AhR ligand and a photoproduct of tryptophan. FICZ and its metabolites have been detected in human fluids. We recently reported that AhR promotes retinoic acid (RA)-induced granulocytic differentiation of HL-60 myeloblastic leukemia cells by restricting the nuclear abundance of the stem cell associated transcription factor Oct4. The standard clinical management of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) is differentiation induction therapy using RA. But RA is not effective for other myeloid leukemias, making the mechanism of RA-induced differentiation observed in a non-APL myeloid leukemia of interest. To our knowledge, this is the first study regarding the influence of FICZ on RA-induced differentiation in any type of leukemic blasts.
METHODS: Using flow cytometry and Western blotting assays, we determined the effects of FICZ on RA-induced differentiation of HL-60 human leukemia cells. All experiments were performed in triplicate. The groups RA and FICZ{\^a}+{\^a}RA were compared using the Paired-Samples T-Test. Western blot figures present the typical blots.
RESULTS: We demonstrate that FICZ enhances RA-induced differentiation, assessed by the expression of the membrane differentiation marker CD11b; cell cycle arrest; and the functional differentiation marker, inducible-oxidative metabolism. FICZ causes changes in signaling events that are known to drive differentiation, and notably augments the RA-induced sustained activation of the RAF/MEK/ERK axis of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade. FICZ also augments expression of the known MAPK signaling regulatory molecules c-Cbl, VAV1, pY458 p85 PI3K, Src-family kinases (SFKs), and IRF-1, a transcription factor associated with this putative signalsome that promotes RA-induced differentiation. Moreover, FICZ in combination with RA also increases expression of AhR and even more so of both Cyp1A2 and p47phox, which are known to be transcriptionally regulated by AhR. pY1021 PDGFR{\^I}², a marker associated with retinoic acid syndrome was also increased.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that FICZ modulates intracellular signaling pathways and enhances RA-induced differentiation.},

	Abstract = {NO appears as an important determinant in auto and paracrine macrophage function. We hypothesized that NO switches monocyte/macrophage function from a pro- to an anti-inflammatory phenotype by activating anti-inflammatory properties of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)gamma. NO-releasing compounds (100 micro M S-nitrosoglutathione or 50 micro M spermine-NONOate) as well as inducible NO synthase induction provoked activation of PPARgamma. This was proven by EMSAs, with the notion that supershift analysis pointed to the involvement of PPARgamma. PCR analysis ruled out induction of PPARgamma mRNA as a result of NO supplementation. Reporter assays, with a construct containing a triple PPAR response element in front of a thymidine kinase minimal promoter driving the luciferase gene, were positive in response to NO delivery. DNA binding capacity as well as the transactivating capability of PPARgamma were attenuated by addition of the antioxidant N-acetyl-cysteine or in the presence of the NO scavenger 2-phenyl-4,4,5,6-tetramethyl-imidazoline-1-oxyl 3-oxide. Having established that NO but not lipophilic cyclic GMP analogs activated PPARgamma, we verified potential anti-inflammatory consequences. The oxidative burst of macrophages, evoked by phorbol ester, was attenuated in association with NO-elicited PPARgamma activation. A cause-effect relationship was demonstrated when PPAR response element decoy oligonucleotides, supplied in front of NO delivery, allowed to regain an oxidative response. PPARgamma-mediated down-regulation of p47 phagocyte oxidase, a component of the NAD(P)H oxidase system, was identified as one molecular mechanism causing inhibition of superoxide radical formation. We conclude that NO participates in controlling the pro- vs anti-inflammatory phenotype of macrophages by modulating PPARgamma.},

	Abstract = {Retinoic acid (RA) is used to treat leukemia and other cancers through its ability to promote cancer cell differentiation. Strategies to enhance the anticancer effects of RA could deepen and broaden its beneficial therapeutic applications. In this study, we describe a receptor cross-talk system that addresses this issue. RA effects are mediated by RAR/RXR receptors that we show are modified by interactions with the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), a protein functioning both as a transcription factor and a ligand-dependent adaptor in an ubiquitin ligase complex. RAR/RXR and AhR pathways cross-talk at the levels of ligand-receptor and also receptor-promoter interactions. Here, we assessed the role of AhR during RA-induced differentiation and a hypothesized convergence at Oct4, a transcription factor believed to maintain stem cell characteristics. RA upregulated AhR and downregulated Oct4 during differentiation of HL-60 promyelocytic leukemia cells. AhR overexpression in stable transfectants downregulated Oct4 and also decreased ALDH1 activity, another stem cell-associated factor, enhancing RA-induced differentiation as indicated by cell differentiation markers associated with early (CD38 and CD11b) and late (neutrophilic respiratory burst) responses. AhR overexpression also increased levels of activated Raf1, which is known to help propel RA-induced differentiation. RNA interference-mediated knockdown of Oct4 enhanced RA-induced differentiation and G(0) cell-cycle arrest relative to parental cells. Consistent with the hypothesized importance of Oct4 downregulation for differentiation, parental cells rendered resistant to RA by biweekly high RA exposure displayed elevated Oct4 levels that failed to be downregulated. Together, our results suggested that therapeutic effects of RA-induced leukemia differentiation depend on AhR and its ability to downregulate the stem cell factor Oct4.},

	Abstract = {B cells have been identified as sensitive cellular targets responsible for 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD)-mediated suppression of humoral immunity. In previous studies, TCDD was shown to produce a significant inhibition of IgM secretion and mu gene expression in LPS-activated CH12.LX B cells (AhR expressing) but not in BCL-1 B cells (AhR deficient). The present studies extend these previous findings by investigating the effect of TCDD on AP-1 and nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB, both of which play an important role in B-cell activation, differentiation, and immunoglobulin (Ig) gene expression. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays and chloramphenicol acetyl transferase reporter gene experiments demonstrated that lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced DNA binding and transcriptional activity of AP-1 was markedly inhibited by TCDD at 24, 48, and 72 h after cellular activation of CH12.LX cells. Conversely, TCDD treatment produced no significant change on the activity of NF-kappaB. Two AhR antagonists, alpha-naphthoflavone and 2,2',5,5'-tetrachlorobiphenyl, attenuated TCDD-induced inhibition of AP-1 binding in CH12.LX cells. Concordant with this result, TCDD did not inhibit LPS-induced AP-1 activity in BCL-1 B cells. Moreover, supershift analysis revealed the major component of the AP-1 complex in LPS-activated CH12.LX cells was c-Jun. Additional studies revealed that the nuclear c-jun and c-jun steady-state mRNA expression was inhibited by TCDD treatment. Collectively, these results suggest that TCDD-induced inhibition of IgM expression by B cells may be mediated, at least in part, through a down-regulation of AP-1 activity in an AhR-dependent manner.},

	Abstract = {Tightly regulated expression of the transcription factor PU.1 is crucial for normal hematopoiesis. PU.1 knockdown mice develop acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and PU.1 mutations have been observed in some populations of patients with AML. Here we found that conditional expression of promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha (PML-RARA), the protein encoded by the t(15;17) translocation found in acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), suppressed PU.1 expression, while treatment of APL cell lines and primary cells with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) restored PU.1 expression and induced neutrophil differentiation. ATRA-induced activation was mediated by a region in the PU.1 promoter to which CEBPB and OCT-1 binding were induced. Finally, conditional expression of PU.1 in human APL cells was sufficient to trigger neutrophil differentiation, whereas reduction of PU.1 by small interfering RNA (siRNA) blocked ATRA-induced neutrophil differentiation. This is the first report to show that PU.1 is suppressed in acute promyelocytic leukemia, and that ATRA restores PU.1 expression in cells harboring t(15;17).},

	Abstract = {The human C/EBP alpha gene promoter shares significant sequence homology with that of the mouse but has a different mechanism of autoregulation. Activation of the murine promoter by direct binding of C/EBP alpha to a site within 200 bp of the transcriptional start was shown to elevate activity by approximately threefold (R. J. Christy, K. H. Kaestner, D. E. Geiman, and M. D. Lane, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 88:2593-2597, 1991; K. Legraverend, P. Antonson, P. Flodby, and K. G. Xanthapoulos, Nucleic Acids Res. 21:1735-1742, 1993). Unlike its murine counterpart, the human C/EBP alpha gene promoter does not contain a cis element that binds the C/EBP alpha protein. Neither C/EBP alpha nor C/EBP beta (NF-Il-6) binds the human C/EBP alpha promoter within 437 bp. However, cotransfection studies show that C/EBP alpha stimulates transcription of a reporter gene driven by 437 bp of the C/EBP alpha promoter. Our studies show that the human C/EBP alpha protein stimulates USF to bind to a USF consensus element within C/EBP alpha promoter and activates it by two- to threefold. We propose that the human gene employs the ubiquitously expressed DNA-binding protein factor USF to carry out autoregulation. Autoregulation of the human C/EBP alpha promoter was abolished by deletion of the USF binding site, CACGTG. Expression of human C/EBP beta following transfection did not stimulate USF binding. These studies suggest a mechanism whereby tissue-specific autoregulation can be achieved via a trans-acting factor that is expressed in all cell types. Thus, direct binding of the C/EBP alpha protein to the promoter of the C/EBP alpha gene is not required for autoregulation.},

	Abstract = {Both positive and negative signals govern the progression of cells from G1 into S phase, and a variety of data implicate the E2F transcription factor as a target for the action of one class of negative regulators, the Rb family of growth suppressors. We now find that the E2F1 gene, which encodes one of the components of E2F activity, is subject to autoregulatory control during progression from G0 to S phase and that this primarily reflects a negative control in G0 and early G1, a time when the majority of E2F activity exits as a complex with Rb family members. In addition, we find that deregulated expression of G1 cyclins in quiescent cells stimulates the E2F1 promoter and that this is augmented by coexpression of cyclin-dependent kinases in an E2F-dependent manner. We conclude that the E2F1 gene is a downstream target for G1 cyclin-dependent kinase activity, most likely as a consequence of phosphorylation of Rb family members, and that the autoregulation of E2F1 transcription may provide a sensitive switch for regulating the accumulation of E2F activity during the transition from G1 to S phase.},

Here, we report the direct binding of C/EBP to the monocyte-specific promoter of CD14. Transactivation analyses demonstrate that C/EBP family members significantly activate the CD14 promoter. These data indicate that C/EBP is directly involved in the regulation of CD14 gene expression. When myelomonoblastic U937 cells are treated with vitamin D(3) and TGF-beta, they differentiate toward monocytic cells. Using specific antibodies against different C/EBP family members in electrophoretic mobility shift assays and Western blot assays, we have identified a specific increase in the DNA binding and the expression of C/EBPalpha and C/EBPbeta during U937 monocytic cell differentiation, and we found C/EBPalpha and C/EBPbeta bind to the promoter in heterodimer. Furthermore, with stably transfected cell lines, we demonstrate that the C/EBP binding site in the CD14 promoter plays a critical role for mediating TGF-beta signaling in the synergistic activation of CD14 expression by vitamin D(3) and TGF-beta during U937 differentiation. This may indicate that C/EBPs have important functions in the process of TGF-beta signal transduction during monocyte differentiation.},

Here we define the regions of C/EBP alpha required for interaction with p21 and demonstrate that CDK2 also interacts with C/EBP alpha. We show that C/EBP alpha can cooperate with p21 to inhibit CDK2 activity in vitro. The effect of C/EBP alpha on CDK2 activity requires the p21 and CDK2 interaction sites within C/EBP alpha. C/EBP alpha mutants incapable of inhibiting CDK2 activity in vitro do not inhibit proliferation in cultured cells. However, C/EBP alpha mutants defective in DNA binding inhibit proliferation as effectively as the wild-type protein. These findings show that C/EBP alpha-mediated growth arrest occurs through protein interactions and is independent of its transcriptional activity.},

	Abstract = {PPARgamma and C/EBPalpha are critical transcription factors in adipogenesis, but the precise role of these proteins has been difficult to ascertain because they positively regulate each other's expression. Questions remain about whether these factors operate independently in separate, parallel pathways of differentiation, or whether a single pathway exists. PPARgamma can promote adipogenesis in C/EBPalpha-deficient cells, but the converse has not been tested. We have created an immortalized line of fibroblasts lacking PPARgamma, which we use to show that C/EBPalpha has no ability to promote adipogenesis in the absence of PPARgamma. These results indicate that C/EBPalpha and PPARgamma participate in a single pathway of fat cell development with PPARgamma being the proximal effector of adipogenesis.},

	Abstract = {The ETS domain transcription factor PU.1 is necessary for the development of monocytes and regulates, in particular, the expression of the monocyte-specific macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) receptor, which is critical for monocytic cell survival, proliferation, and differentiation. The bZIP transcription factor c-Jun, which is part of the AP-1 transcription factor complex, is also important for monocytic differentiation, but the monocyte-specific M-CSF receptor promoter has no AP-1 consensus binding sites. We asked the question of whether c-Jun could promote the induction of the M-CSF receptor by collaborating with PU.1. We demonstrate that c-Jun enhances the ability of PU.1 to transactivate the M-CSF receptor promoter as well as a minimal thymidine kinase promoter containing only PU.1 DNA binding sites. c-Jun does not directly bind to the M-CSF receptor promoter but associates via its basic domain with the ETS domain of PU.1. Consistent with our observation that AP-1 binding does not contribute to c-Jun coactivation is the observation that the activation of PU.1 by c-Jun is blocked by overexpression of c-Fos. Phosphorylation of c-Jun by c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase on Ser-63 and -73 does not alter the ability of c-Jun to enhance PU.1 transactivation. Activated Ras enhances the transcriptional activity of PU.1 by up-regulating c-Jun expression without changing the phosphorylation pattern of PU.1. The activation of PU.1 by Ras is blocked by a mutant c-Jun protein lacking the basic domain. The expression of this mutant form of c-Jun also completely blocks 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate-induced M-CSF receptor promoter activity during monocytic differentiation. We propose therefore that c-Jun acts as a c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase-independent coactivator of PU.1, resulting in M-CSF receptor expression and development of the monocytic lineage.},

	Abstract = {The cell cycle inhibitor protein p21(WAF1/Cip1) (p21) is a critical downstream effector in p53-dependent mechanisms of growth control and p53-independent pathways of terminal differentiation. We have recently reported that the transforming growth factor-beta pathway-specific Smad3 and Smad4 proteins transactivate the human p21 promoter via a short proximal region, which contains multiple binding sites for the ubiquitous transcription factor Sp1. In the present study we show that the Sp1-occupied promoter region mediates transactivation of the p21 promoter by c-Jun and the related proteins JunB, JunD, and ATF-2. By using gel electrophoretic mobility shift assays we show that this region does not contain a binding site for c-Jun. In accordance with the DNA binding data, c-Jun was unable to transactivate the p21 promoter when overexpressed in the Sp1-deficient Drosophila-derived SL2 cells. Coexpression of c-Jun and Sp1 in these cells resulted in a strong synergistic transactivation of this promoter. In addition, a chimeric promoter consisting of six tandem high affinity Sp1-binding sites fused with the CAT gene was transactivated by overexpressed c-Jun in HepG2 cells. The above data propose functional cooperation between c-Jun and Sp1. Physical interactions between the two factors were demonstrated in vitro by using GST-Sp1 hybrid proteins expressed in bacteria and in vitro transcribed-translated c-Jun. The region of c-Jun mediating interaction with Sp1 was mapped within the basic region leucine zipper domain. In vivo, functional interactions between c-Jun and Sp1 were demonstrated using a GAL4-based transactivation assay. Overexpressed c-Jun transactivated a chimeric promoter consisting of five tandem GAL4-binding sites only when coexpressed with GAL4-Sp1-(83-778) fusion proteins in HepG2 cells. By utilizing the same assay, we found that the glutamine-rich segment of the B domain of Sp1 (Bc, amino acids 424-542) was sufficient for c-Jun-induced transactivation of the p21 promoter. In conclusion, our data support a mechanism of superactivation of Sp1 by c-Jun, which is based on physical and functional interactions between these two transcription factors on the human p21 and possibly other Sp1-dependent promoters.},

	Abstract = {The myeloid-specific transcription factor PU.1 is essential for expression of p47(phox), a component of the superoxide-forming phagocyte NADPH oxidase. The consensus PU.1 binding sequence (GAGGAA) is located on the non-coding strand from position -40 to -45 relative to the transcriptional start site of the p47phox promoter. A promoter construct extending to -46 was sufficient to drive tissue-specific expression of the luciferase reporter gene, but extension of the promoter from -46 to -48 resulted in a significant increase in reporter expression. Mutations of the nucleotides G at -46 and/or T at -47 reduced both reporter expression and PU.1 binding, whereas mutations at -48 had no effect. The PU.1 binding avidity of these sequences correlated closely with their capacity to dictate reporter gene transcription. In parallel studies on the functional PU.1 site in the promoter of CD18, mutations of nucleotides G and T at positions -76 and -77 (corresponding to -46 and -47, respectively, of the p47phox promoter) reduced PU.1 binding and nearly abolished the contribution of this element to promoter activity. We conclude that the immediate flanking nucleotides of the PU.1 consensus motif have significant effects on PU.1 binding avidity and activity and that this region is the dominant cis element regulating p47phox expression.},

In this study, we document that overexpression of Egr-1 activates the human PPARgamma1 promoter in both VSMC and HepG2 cells. Using Northern blot analysis, we observed that growth factors and cytokines such as PDGF, bFGF, Ang II, TNFalpha, and IL-1beta induce Egr-1 expression prior to PPARgamma1 up-regulation in human VSMC. In addition, overexpression of a constitutively active form of Egr-1 by adenoviral gene transfer in VSMC dramatically induced PPARgamma1 gene expression by 6-8-fold, and overexpression of NAB2, a potent negative feedback regulator of Egr-1, abrogated the growth factor- and cytokine-induced PPARgamma1 expression in VSMC. Furthermore, we demonstrate with gel mobility shift and transient transfection assays that the putative Egr-1 element in the human PPARgamma1 promoter specifically binds Egr-1 protein and becomes trans-activated by Egr-1. Taken together, our data demonstrate for the first time that Egr-1 is necessary and sufficient to activate human PPARgamma1 gene expression in VSMC.},

	Abstract = {Knockdown of the transcription factor PU.1 (encoded by Sfpi1) leads to acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in mice. We examined the transcriptome of preleukemic hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in which PU.1 was knocked down (referred to as 'PU.1-knockdown HSCs') to identify transcriptional changes preceding malignant transformation. Transcription factors c-Jun and JunB were among the top-downregulated targets. Restoration of c-Jun expression in preleukemic cells rescued the PU.1 knockdown-initiated myelomonocytic differentiation block. Lentiviral restoration of JunB at the leukemic stage led to loss of leukemic self-renewal capacity and prevented leukemia in NOD-SCID mice into which leukemic PU.1-knockdown cells were transplanted. Examination of human individuals with AML confirmed the correlation between PU.1 and JunB downregulation. These results delineate a transcriptional pattern that precedes leukemic transformation in PU.1-knockdown HSCs and demonstrate that decreased levels of c-Jun and JunB contribute to the development of PU.1 knockdown-induced AML by blocking differentiation and increasing self-renewal. Therefore, examination of disturbed gene expression in HSCs can identify genes whose dysregulation is essential for leukemic stem cell function and that are targets for therapeutic interventions.},

	Abstract = {Ectopic expression of CAAT/enhancer binding protein {\^I}$\pm$ (C/EBP{\^I}$\pm$) in p210BCR/ABL-expressing cells induces granulocytic differentiation, inhibits proliferation, and suppresses leukemogenesis. To dissect the molecular mechanisms underlying these biological effects, C/EBP{\^I}$\pm$-regulated genes were identified by microarray analysis in 32D-p210BCR/ABL cells. One of the genes whose expression was activated by C/EBP{\^I}$\pm$ in a DNA binding-dependent manner in BCR/ABL-expressing cells is the transcriptional repressor Gfi-1. We show here that C/EBP{\^I}$\pm$ interacts with a functional C/EBP binding site in the Gfi-1 5'-flanking region and enhances the promoter activity of Gfi-1. Moreover, in K562 cells, RNA interference-mediated downregulation of Gfi-1 expression partially rescued the proliferation-inhibitory but not the differentiation-inducing effect of C/EBP{\^I}$\pm$. Ectopic expression of wild-type Gfi-1, but not of a transcriptional repressor mutant (Gfi-1P2A), inhibited proliferation and markedly suppressed colony formation but did not induce granulocytic differentiation of BCR/ABL-expressing cells. By contrast, Gfi-1 short hairpin RNA-tranduced CD34(+) chronic myeloid leukemia cells were markedly more clonogenic than the scramble-transduced counterpart. Together, these studies indicate that Gfi-1 is a direct target of C/EBP{\^I}$\pm$ required for its proliferation and survival-inhibitory effects in BCR/ABL-expressing cells.},

	Abstract = {The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) is a ligand-activated transcription factor that has been implicated in the induction of differentiation of various cell types, including human uroepithelial cells. PPARgamma-mediated differentiation of normal human urothelial (NHU) cells in vitro requires coinhibition of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signalling and is characterised by de novo expression of late/terminal differentiation-associated genes, including uroplakins (UPK), over a 6-day period. We used gene microarrays to identify intermediary transcription factors induced in direct response to PPARgamma activation of EGFR-inhibited NHU cells. FOXA1 and IRF-1 contained consensus cognate binding sites in UPK1a, UPK2, and UPK3a promoters and transcripts were induced within 12 h of PPARgamma activation; transcription complex formation was confirmed by electromobility shift assays. In urothelium in situ, both FOXA1 and IRF-1 were nuclear and expressed in a differentiation-associated pattern. Knockdown by transient siRNA of either FOXA1 or IRF-1 abrogated PPARgamma-induced uroplakin expression in vitro. This is the first evidence that ligand activation of PPARgamma induces expression of intermediary transcription factors that mediate an epithelial differentiation programme and represents a new paradigm for understanding differentiation, regenerative repair and inflammation in epithelial tissues.},

	Abstract = {Over the last quarter century, more than 532 genes have been put forward as regulatory targets of retinoic acid. In some cases this control is direct, driven by a liganded heterodimer of retinoid receptors bound to a DNA response element; in others, it is indirect, reflecting the actions of intermediate transcription factors, non-classical associations of receptors with other proteins, or even more distant mechanisms. Given the broad range of scientific questions continually under investigation, researchers do not always have occasion to classify target genes along these lines. However, our understanding of the genetic role of retinoids will be enhanced if such a distinction can be made for each regulated gene. We have therefore evaluated published data from 1,191 papers covering 532 genes and have classified these genes into four categories according to the degree to which an hypothesis of direct versus indirect control is supported overall. We found 27 genes that are unquestionably direct targets of the classical pathway in permissive cellular contexts (Category 3 genes), plus 105 genes that appear to be candidates, pending the results of specific additional experiments (Category 2). Data on another 267 targets are not evocative of direct or indirect regulation either way, although control by retinoic acid through some mechanism is clear (Category 1). Most of the remaining 133 targets seem to be regulated indirectly, usually through a transcriptional intermediary, in the contexts studied so far (Category 0).},

	Abstract = {All-trans retinoic acid (RA) and interferons (IFNs) have efficacy in treating certain leukemias and lymphomas, respectively, motivating interest in their mechanism of action to improve therapy. Both RA and IFNs induce interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1). We find that in HL-60 myeloblastic leukemia cells which undergo mitogen activated protien kinase (MAPK)-dependent myeloid differentiation in response to RA, IRF-1 propels differentiation. RA induces MAPK-dependent expression of IRF-1. IRF-1 binds c-Cbl, a MAPK related adaptor. Ectopic IRF-1 expression causes CD38 expression and activation of the Raf/MEK/ERK axis, and enhances RA-induced differentiation by augmenting CD38, CD11b, respiratory burst and G0 arrest. Ectopic IRF-1 expression also decreases the activity of aldehyde dehydrogenase 1, a stem cell marker, and enhances RA-induced ALDH1 down-regulation. Interestingly, expression of aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), which is RA-induced and known to down-regulate Oct4 and drive RA-induced differentiation, also enhances IRF-1 expression. The data are consistent with a model whereby IRF-1 acts downstream of RA and AhR to enhance Raf/MEK/ERK activation and propel differentiation.},

	Abstract = {Hematopoietic stem cells and their progenitors exhibit multilineage patterns of gene expression. Molecular mechanisms underlying the generation and refinement of these patterns during cell fate determination remain unexplored because of the absence of suitable experimental systems. Using PU.1(-/-) progenitors, we demonstrate that at subthreshold levels, this Ets transcription factor regulates a mixed pattern (macrophage/neutrophil) of gene expression within individual myeloid progenitors. Increased PU.1 levels refine the pattern and promote macrophage differentiation by modulating a novel regulatory circuit comprised of counter antagonistic repressors, Egr-1,2/Nab-2 and Gfi-1. Egr-1 and Egr-2 function redundantly to activate macrophage genes and to repress the neutrophil program. These results are used to assemble and mathematically model a gene regulatory network that exhibits both graded and bistable behaviors and accounts for the onset and resolution of mixed lineage patterns during cell fate determination.},

	Abstract = {Insulin stimulates glucose uptake through the membrane translocation of GLUT4 and GLUT1. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor {\^I}³ (PPAR{\^I}³) enhances insulin sensitivity. Here, we demonstrate that insulin stimulates GLUT4 and GLUT1 translocation, and glucose uptake, by activating the signaling pathway involving nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAADP), a calcium mobilizer, in adipocytes. We also demonstrate that PPAR{\^I}³ mediates insulin sensitization by enhancing NAADP production through upregulation of CD38, the only enzyme identified for NAADP synthesis. Insulin produced NAADP by both CD38-dependent and -independent pathways, whereas PPAR{\^I}³ produced NAADP by CD38-dependent pathway. Blocking the NAADP signaling pathway abrogated both insulin-stimulated and PPAR{\^I}³-induced GLUT4 and GLUT1 translocation, thereby inhibiting glucose uptake. CD38 knockout partially inhibited insulin-stimulated glucose uptake. However, CD38 knockout completely blocked PPAR{\^I}³-induced glucose uptake in adipocytes and PPAR{\^I}³-mediated amelioration of glucose tolerance in diabetic mice. These results demonstrated that the NAADP signaling pathway is a critical molecular target for PPAR{\^I}³-mediated insulin sensitization.},

	Abstract = {Activating mutations in ras oncogenes occur at high frequency in human malignancies and expression of activated ras in immortalized cells lines is generally transforming. However, somewhat paradoxically, ectopic expression of ras in some myeloid cell lines has been shown to induce growth suppression associated with up-regulation of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21(CIP1/WAF1) in a p16(INK4a), p15(INK4b), and p53 independent fashion. We have used cDNA array technology to compare the expression profile induced by activated N-ras (N-rasG13R) in growth-suppressed myeloid cells with that induced in myeloid cells, which are transformed by N-rasG13R. The expression profile induced in growth suppressed cells was consistent with differentiation and included the up-regulation of the transcription factor IFN regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1), a known transcriptional activator of p21(CIP/WAF1) expression and a target of oncogenic mutations associated with myeloid leukemia. Antisense suppression of IRF-1 prevented N-rasG13R-associated growth arrest and up-regulation of p21(CIP1/WAF1). These results define a novel tumor suppressive response to oncogenic signaling and provide a mechanistic link between growth suppression and differentiation in myeloid cells.},

Here we show that the murine PU.1 promoter is also specifically and highly functional in B cell lines as well. Oct-1 and Oct-2 can bind specifically to a site at base pair -55 in vitro, and this site is specifically protected in B cells in vivo. We also demonstrate that two other sites contribute to promoter activity in B cells; an Sp1 binding site adjacent to the octamer site, and the PU.1 autoregulatory site. Finally, we show that the B cell coactivator OBF-1/Bob1/OCA-B is only expressed in B cells and not in myeloid cells, and that OBF-1/Bob1/OCA-B can transactivate the PU.1 promoter in HeLa and myeloid cells. This B cell restricted coactivator may be responsible for the B cell specific expression of PU.1 mediated by the octamer site.},

	Abstract = {Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a pleiotropic cytokine, whose plasma levels are elevated in inflammatory diseases such as atherosclerosis. We have previously reported that peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARalpha) ligands (fibrates) lower elevated plasma concentrations of IL-6 in patients with atherosclerosis and inhibit IL-1-stimulated IL-6 secretion by human aortic smooth muscle cells (SMC). Here, we show that aortic explants isolated from PPARalpha-null mice display an exacerbated response to inflammatory stimuli, such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS), as demonstrated by increased IL-6 secretion. Furthermore, fibrate treatment represses IL-6 mRNA levels in LPS-stimulated aortas of PPARalpha wild-type, but not of PPARalpha-null mice, demonstrating a role for PPARalpha in this fibrate action. In human aortic SMC, fibrates inhibit IL-1-induced IL-6 gene expression. Furthermore, activation of PPARalpha represses both c-Jun- and p65-induced transcription of the human IL-6 promoter. Transcriptional interference between PPARalpha and both c-Jun and p65 occurs reciprocally, since c-Jun and p65 also inhibit PPARalpha-mediated activation of a PPAR response element-driven promoter. This transcriptional interference occurs independent of the promoter context as demonstrated by cotransfection experiments using PPARalpha, p65, and c-Jun Gal4 chimeras. Overexpression of the transcriptional coactivator cAMP-responsive element-binding protein-binding protein (CBP) does not relieve PPARalpha-mediated transcriptional repression of p65 and c-Jun. Finally, glutathione S-transferase pull-down experiments demonstrate that PPARalpha physically interacts with c-Jun, p65, and CBP. Altogether these data indicate that fibrates inhibit the vascular inflammatory response via PPARalpha by interfering with the NF-kappaB and AP-1 transactivation capacity involving direct protein-protein interaction with p65 and c-Jun.},

We show here that ligand activation of PPAR gamma is sufficient to induce growth arrest in fibroblasts and SV40 large T-antigen transformed, adipogenic HIB1B cells. Cell cycle withdrawal is accompanied by a decrease in the DNA-binding and transcriptional activity of the E2F/DP complex, which is attributable to an increase in the phosphorylation of these proteins, especially DP-1. This effect is a consequence of decreased expression of the catalytic subunit of the serine-threonine phosphatase PP2A.

The ETS transcription factor PU.1 has a potent ability to confer macrophage phenotypes on cells already committed to a different lineage, but how it overcomes the presence of other master regulators is not known. The nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor {\^I}³ (PPAR{\^I}³) is the master regulator of the adipose lineage, and its genomic binding pattern in adipocytes is well characterized. Here we show that, when expressed at macrophage levels in mature adipocytes, PU.1 bound a large fraction of its macrophage sites, where it induced chromatin opening and the expression of macrophage target genes. Strikingly, PU.1 markedly reduced the genomic binding of PPAR{\^I}³ without changing its abundance. PU.1 expression repressed genes with nearby adipocyte-specific PPAR{\^I}³ binding sites, while a common macrophage-adipocyte gene expression program was retained. Together, these data reveal unexpected lability within the adipocyte PPAR{\^I}³ cistrome and show that, even in terminally differentiated cells, PU.1 can remodel the cistrome of another master regulator.},

	Abstract = {PU.1 has previously been shown to be down-regulated in classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL) cells via promoter methylation. We performed bisulfite sequencing and proved that the promoter region and the -17 kb upstream regulatory element of the PU.1 gene were highly methylated. To evaluate whether down-regulation of PU.1 is essential for the growth of cHL cells, we conditionally expressed PU.1 in 2 cHL cell lines, L428 and KM-H2. Overexpression of PU.1 induced complete growth arrest and apoptosis in both cell lines. Furthermore, in a Hodgkin lymphoma tumor xenograft model using L428 and KM-H2 cell lines, overexpression of PU.1 led to tumor regression or stable disease. Lentiviral transduction of PU.1 into primary cHL cells also induced apoptosis. DNA microarray analysis revealed that among genes related to cell cycle and apoptosis, p21 (CDKN1A) was highly up-regulated in L428 cells after PU.1 induction. Stable knockdown of p21 rescued PU.1-induced growth arrest in L428 cells, suggesting that the growth arrest and apoptosis observed are at least partially dependent on p21 up-regulation. These data strongly suggest that PU.1 is a potent tumor suppressor in cHL and that induction of PU.1 with demethylation agents and/or histone deacetylase inhibitors is worth exploring as a possible therapeutic option for patients with cHL.},

	Abstract = {PU.1 (Spi-1), a member of the Ets transcription factor family, is predominantly expressed in myeloid (granulocytes, monocytes and macrophages) and B cells. PU.1 is upregulated early during commitment of multipotential progenitors to the myeloid lineages and inhibition of PU.1 function in human CD34+ progenitors prior to this upregulation blocks myeloid colony formation. Since PU.1 expression appears to play a role in hematopoietic development, we characterized the PU.1 promoter. Here we report that the murine PU.1 promoter, as well as the human promoter, demonstrate tissue-specific reporter gene expression in myeloid cell lines but not in T cells and HeLa (non-hematopoietic cells) cells. Deletion analysis of the PU.1 promoter indicates that tissue-specific functional elements are encoded in the -61 to -39 bp and -7 to +34 bp regions. The first region contains a functional octamer (Oct) site at -54 bp and an Sp1 site at -39 bp. The second contains a binding site at +20 bp for both PU.1 itself and the related ets family member Spi-B. In vivo footprinting assays demonstrate that a hypersensitive band was detected at the PU.1 site in myeloid cells but not in HeLa. A mutation of the PU.1 site which abolished PU.1 binding caused a significant decrease in promoter activity. Mutation of the Oct and/or Sp1 site results in a lesser decrease of promoter activity in myeloid cells. Co-transfection of PU.1 or Spi-B in cells lacking PU.1 and Spi-B specifically transactivated a minimal promoter containing the PU.1 binding site, indicating that PU.1 can activate its own promoter elements in an autoregulatory loop. Positive autoregulation of the PU.1 promoter may play an important role in the function of PU.1 in myeloid cells.},

	Abstract = {Two major pathways of human myeloid dendritic cell (DC) subset differentiation have previously been delineated. Langerhans cells (LCs) reside in epithelia in the steady state, whereas monocytes can provide dendritic cells (DCs) on demand in response to inflammatory signals. Both DC subset pathways arise from shared CD14+ monocyte precursors, which in turn develop from myeloid committed progenitor cells. However, the underlying hematopoietic mechanisms still remain poorly defined. Here, we demonstrate that the vitamin D(3) receptor (VDR) is induced by transforming growth factor beta1 during LC lineage commitment and exerts a positive role during LC generation. In contrast, VDR is repressed during interleukin-4 (IL-4)-dependent monocyte-derived DC (moDC) differentiation. We identified GATA-1 as a repressor of VDR. GATA-1 is induced by IL-4 in moDCs. Forced inducible expression of GATA-1 mimics IL-4 in redirecting moDC differentiation and vice versa, GATA-1 knockdown arrests moDC differentiation at the monocyte stage. Moreover, ectopic GATA-1 expression stabilizes the moDC phenotype under monocyte-promoting conditions in the presence of vitamin D3 (VD3). In summary, human myeloid DC subset differentiation is inversely regulated by GATA-1 and VDR. GATA-1 mediates the repression of VDR and enables IL-4-dependent moDC differentiation. Conversely, VDR is induced downstream of transforming growth factor beta1 and is functionally involved in promoting LC differentiation.},

	Abstract = {Hematopoietic transcription factors are essential for specifying cell fates; however, the function of cytokines in such developmental decisions is unresolved. We demonstrate here that haploinsufficiency for the gene encoding the transcription factor PU.1 partially suppresses the neutropenia of mice deficient in granulocyte colony-stimulating factor. This suppression was due to an increase in granulocytic progenitors and a diminution of monocytic progenitors. With (PU.1+/-) ES cells as well as (PU.1-/-) hematopoietic progenitors, we show that higher expression of PU.1 is needed for macrophage than for neutrophil development. In a (PU.1-/-) progenitor cell line, in which graded activity of PU.1 regulates neutrophil versus macrophage development, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor signaling supported the neutrophil cell fate by increasing expression of the neutrophil transcription factor C/EBPalpha in relation to expression of PU.1. Collectively, these results indicate that cytokines can promote cell fate decisions by altering the relative concentrations of lineage-determining transcriptional regulators.},

	Abstract = {Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) gamma is activated by thiazolidinediones (TZDs), widely used as insulin-sensitizing agents for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. TZDs have been shown to induce apoptosis in a variety of mammalian cells. In vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs), proliferation and apoptosis may be competing processes during the formation of restenotic and atherosclerotic lesions. The precise molecular mechanisms by which TZDs induce apoptosis in VSMCs, however, remain unclear. In the present study, we demonstrate that the TZDs rosiglitazone (RSG), troglitazone (TRO), and a novel non-TZD partial PPARgamma agonist (nTZDpa) induce caspase-mediated apoptosis of human coronary VSMCs. Induction of VSMC apoptosis correlated closely with an upregulation of growth arrest and DNA damage-inducible gene 45 (GADD45) mRNA expression and transcription, a well-recognized modulator of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Using adenoviral-mediated overexpression of a constitutively active PPARgamma mutant and the irreversible PPARgamma antagonist GW9662, we provide evidence that PPARgamma ligands induce caspase-mediated apoptosis and GADD45 expression through a receptor-dependent pathway. Deletion analysis of the GADD45 promoter revealed that a 153-bp region between -234 and -81 bp proximal to the transcription start site, containing an Oct-1 element, was crucial for the PPARgamma ligand-mediated induction of the GADD45 promoter. PPARgamma activation induced Oct-1 protein expression and DNA binding and stimulated activity of a reporter plasmid driven by multiple Oct-1 elements. These findings suggest that activation of PPARgamma can lead to apoptosis and growth arrest in VSMCs, at least in part, by inducing Oct-1-mediated transcription of GADD45.

K. Rishi et al., Cancer Res., 55: 4999-5006, 1995). Most ER-negative HBCs are known to express lower levels of RARalpha and are resistant to RA-mediated inhibition of growth. We show that ER-negative SKBR-3 and MDA-MB-435 HBCs express approximately 2-fold higher levels of RARalpha isoform 1 mRNA when compared to the ER-negative MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 HBCs. SKBR-3 cells are sensitive to growth inhibition by RA, and by using RARalpha-selective synthetic retinoids, we demonstrate that the antiproliferative effects of RA in the SKBR-3 cell line are accomplished, in part, via activation of RARalpha. Both MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 HBCs are not growth inhibited by RA or any of the retinoids tested. Transient transfection experiments using a 5.0-kb RARalpha promoter fragment fused to the luciferase reporter gene showed 2-3-fold higher transcriptional activation in SKBR-3 cells when compared to MDA-MB-468 cells. We report identification of a 72-bp fragment of RARalpha promoter that contains unique cis elements responsible for mediating an estradiol-independent 2.5-fold enhancement of RARalpha gene expression in SKBR-3 and MDA-MB-435 cells.},

	Abstract = {To unravel the network of transcription factors established during development it is important to understand how genes specifically expressed during embryogenesis are regulated. Oct-4 is a transcription factor whose expression is associated with an undifferentiated cell phenotype in the early mouse embryo and is downregulated when such cells differentiate. An enhancer in the upstream region of Oct-4 has previously been reported as being sufficient to mediate the cell-type specific expression and RA-dependent down-regulation in EC cells, although the enhancer contains no retinoic acid receptor (RAR) binding sites. Here we report the identification of promoter elements important for the regulation of the Oct-4 gene in EC cells. A region of the proximal Oct-4 promoter contains an overlapping set of regulatory elements including a high affinity binding site for Sp1 and three direct repeats of an AGGTCA-like sequence with either +1 or 0 spacing. Binding and transient transfection assays reveal that Oct-4 is subject to negative regulation by different members of the steroid-thyroid hormone receptor superfamily. Specifically, important roles for ARP-1 and RAR in Oct-4 expression are indicated.},

	Abstract = {Interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1), a transcription factor and tumor suppressor involved in cell growth regulation and immune responses, has been shown to be induced by all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA). However, the factors controlling the cellular location and activity of IRF-1 are not well understood. In this study, we examined the expression of IRF-1 and its nuclear localization, DNA-binding activity, and target gene expression in human mammary epithelial MCF10A cells, a model of breast epithelial cell differentiation and carcinogenesis. Following initial treatment with ATRA, IRF-1 mRNA and protein were induced within 2 hrs, reached a peak (>30-fold induction) at 8 hrs, and declined afterwards. IRF-1 protein was predominantly cytoplasmic during this treatment. Although a second dose of ATRA or Am580 (a related retinoid selective for retinoic acid receptor-alpha [RARalpha]), given 16 hrs after the first dose, restimulated IRF-1 mRNA and protein levels to a similar level to that obtained by the first dose, IRF-1 was predominantly concentrated in the nucleus after restimulation. ATRA and Am580 also increased nuclear RARalpha, whereas retinoid X receptor-alpha (RXRalpha)--a dimerization partner for RARalpha, was localized to the nucleus upon second exposure to ATRA. However, ATRA and Am580 did not regulate the expression or activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription-1 (STAT-1), a transcription factor capable of inducing the expression of IRF-1, indicating an STAT-1-independent mechanism of regulation by ATRA and Am580. The increase in nuclear IRF-1 after retinoid restimulation was accompanied by enhanced binding to an IRF-E DNA response element, and elevated expression of an IRF-1 target gene, 2',5'-oligoadenylate synthetase-2. The dual effect of retinoids in increasing IRF-1 mRNA and protein and in augmenting the nuclear localization of IRF-1 protein may be essential for maximizing the tumor suppressor activity and the immunosurveillance functions of IRF-1 in breast epithelial cells.},

	Abstract = {CD38 is a leukocyte differentiation antigen that has been thought to be a phenotypic marker of different subpopulations of T- and B-lymphocytes. In myeloid cells, CD38 is expressed during early stages of differentiation. Virtually no information is available on regulation and functions of CD38. Recently we reported that all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) is a potent and highly specific inducer of CD38 expression in human promyelocytic leukemia cells. Here we report that ATRA-induced expression of CD38 antigen in myeloid cells is mediated through retinoic acid-alpha receptor (RAR alpha). ATRA failed to induce CD38 expression in a mutant subclone of the HL-60 myeloid leukemia cell line (designated HL-60R) that is relatively resistant to ATRA-induced granulocytic differentiation. Retroviral vector-mediated transduction of RA receptor (RAR alpha) into this HL-60R subclone completely restored the sensitivity of these cells to ATRA in terms of their ability to express CD38. In contrast, CD38 expression was not inducible by ATRA in HL-60R cells, transfected with a functional RAR beta, RAR gamma, or RXR alpha receptor. Induction of CD38 in acute promyelocytic and acute myeloblastic leukemia cells was independent of ATRA-induced cytodifferentiation. Following culture with ATRA, increased CD38 protein levels were also observed in normal CD34+ bone marrow cells, but not on normal circulating granulocytes. From these results, we conclude that CD38 is ATRA inducible in myeloid leukemia cells and normal CD34+ bone marrow cells. This effect is independent of differentiation and is mediated by RAR alpha in HL-60 cells, suggesting a similar role for RAR alpha in CD38 expression in other hematopoietic cells.},

	Abstract = {Nuclear hormone receptors have been shown to be important transcription factors for regulating lipid metabolism in myeloid cells and were also implicated in differentiation processes of the myeloid lineage and macrophages. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) seems to be a key component of lipid uptake by inducing the scavenger receptor CD36 that mediates oxidized low-density lipoprotein uptake in macrophages. Retinoic acid receptors, on the other hand, were also shown to play important roles in myeloid cell differentiation. In this study, we present evidence for a cross-talk between these two nuclear receptor pathways in myeloid cells. We show that expression level of PPARgamma increases with the degree of monocyte/macrophage commitment during maturation. Activation of PPARgamma leads to the increased expression of maturation markers (e.g., CD14, CD36). It is interesting that retinoid treatment potentiates PPARgamma's ability to induce transcription of its target genes. Retinoid-increased PPARgamma response is sufficient for enhancing lipid uptake. Our data, taken together, indicate that the expression level of PPARgamma increases during monocyte/macrophage development. PPARgamma activity can be enhanced by retinoids at least in part via increasing PPARgamma expression level. These observations can be exploited to enhance therapeutically beneficial PPAR responses in myeloid cells.},

	Abstract = {Gfi-1 is a zinc finger transcriptional repressor originally recognized for its role in T cell differentiation and lymphomas. Recent experiments reveal that gene-targeted Gfi-1-deficient mice are neutropenic and that Gfi-1 mutations cause human neutropenia. In both cases, myeloid progenitor cells lose the ability to distinctly differentiate granulocytes from monocytes. The molecular mechanism of the hematopoietic abnormalities caused by Gfi-1 deficiency remains undetermined because of a lack of known Gfi-1 target genes. To identify Gfi-1 targets in vivo, we performed large-scale chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis on a set of 34 candidate genes in myeloblast (KG-1 and HL-60), monoblast (U937), and T lymphocyte cell lines (Jurkat), in concert with RT-PCR-based expression profiling. We identified 32 Gfi-1 binding sites in a functionally variable set of 16 genes, including complements of cell-cycle regulators, transcription factors, and granulocyte-specific markers. Cluster analysis of expression patterns and chromatin immunoprecipitation data reveals that Gfi-1 targets a subset of genes differentiating hematopoietic lineages and therefore plays a relatively superior role in the hierarchy of factors governing stem cell differentiation.},

	Abstract = {The transcription factor C/EBP alpha (CCAAT/enhancer binding protein alpha) is critical for granulopoiesis. Gene disruption in mice blocks early granulocyte differentiation and disruption of C/EBP alpha function has been implicated in human acute myeloid leukemia (AML), but no systematic structure-function analysis has been undertaken to identify the mechanisms involved in C/EBP alpha-mediated granulocyte differentiation. Here we demonstrate that loss of either of 2 key regions results in disruption of C/EBP alpha granulocytic development: the amino terminus and specific residues residing on the non-DNA binding face of the basic region. Mutation of either results in loss of C/EBP alpha inhibition of E2F and down-regulation of c-Myc, but only mutation of the basic region results in loss of physical interaction with E2F. In contrast, while the amino terminal mutant retains the ability to interact with E2F, this mutant fails to bind a C/EBP alpha site efficiently, fails to activate C/EBP alpha target genes, and is also defective in inhibition of E2F activity. These results further emphasize the importance of inhibition of proliferative pathways in granulopoiesis and demonstrate that several regions of the C/EBP alpha protein are involved in this mechanism.},

Real-time PCR analysis of breast and prostate cancer cell lines demonstrated that PPARdelta expression was increased 1.5 to 3.2-fold after three hours stimulation with the natural vitamin D receptor (VDR) agonist, 1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1alpha,25(OH)2D3). In silico analysis of the 20 kb of the human PPARdelta promoter revealed a DR3-type 1alpha,25(OH)2D3 response element approximately 350 bp upstream of the transcription start site, which was able to bind VDR-retinoid X receptor (RXR) heterodimers and mediate a 1alpha,25(OH)2D3-dependent upregulation of reporter gene activity. Chromatin immuno-precipitation assays demonstrated that a number of proteins representative for 1alpha,25(OH)2D3-mediated gene activation, such as VDR, RXR and RNA polymerase II, displayed a 1alpha,25(OH)2D3-dependent association with a region of the proximal PPARdelta promoter that contained the putative DR3-type VDRE. This was also true for other proteins that are involved in or are the subject of chromatin modification, such as the histone acetyltransferase CBP and histone 4, which displayed ligand-dependent association and acetylation, respectively. Finally, real-time PCR analysis demonstrated that 1alpha,25(OH)2D3 and the synthetic PPARdelta ligand L783483 show a cell and time-dependent interference in each other's effects on VDR mRNA expression, so that their combined application shows complex effects on the induction of VDR target genes, such as CYP24. Taken together, we conclude that PPARdelta is a primary 1alpha,25(OH)2D3-responding gene and that VDR and PPARdelta signaling pathways are interconnected at the level of cross-regulation of their respective transcription factor mRNA levels.},

	Abstract = {Mice lacking the zinc finger transcriptional repressor protein GFI-1 are neutropenic. These mice generate abnormal immature myeloid cells exhibiting characteristics of both macrophages and granulocytes. Furthermore, Gfi-1(-/-) mice are highly susceptible to bacterial infection. Interestingly, Gfi-1(-/-) myeloid cells overexpress target genes of the PU.1 transcription factor such as the macrophage colony-stimulating factor receptor and PU.1 itself. We therefore determined whether GFI-1 modulates the transcriptional activity of PU.1. Our data demonstrate that GFI-1 physically interacts with PU.1, repressing PU.1-dependent transcription. This repression is functionally significant, as GFI-1 blocked PU.1-induced macrophage differentiation of a multipotential hematopoietic progenitor cell line. Retroviral expression of GFI-1 in primary murine hematopoietic progenitors increased granulocyte differentiation at the expense of macrophage differentiation. We interbred Gfi-1(+/-) and PU.1(+/-) mice and observed that heterozygosity at the PU.1 locus partially rescued the Gfi-1(-/-) mixed myeloid lineage phenotype, but failed to restore granulocyte differentiation. Our data demonstrate that GFI-1 represses PU.1 activity and that lack of this repression in Gfi-1(-/-) myeloid cells contributes to the observed mixed lineage phenotype.},

	Abstract = {The hormonal form of vitamin D, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, acting through its cognate nuclear receptor (vitamin D3 receptor, VDR) will induce myeloid leukemic cell lines to terminally differentiate into monocytes/macrophages. Because VDR acts by transcriptionally regulating responsive genes in a ligand-dependent manner, we sought target genes of the receptor that initiate, the differentiation process in response to ligand. We screened a cDNA library prepared from the myelomonocytic U937 cell line with probes generated from either 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3-treated or untreated cells. We report here that a candidate clone that hybridized differentially is the Cdk inhibitor p21WAF1, CIP1. Furthermore, we show that p21 is transcriptionally induced by 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 in a VDR-dependent, but not p53-dependent, manner, and we identify a functional vitamin D response element in the p21 promoter. Transient overexpression of p21 and/or the related Cdk inhibitor p27 in U937 cells in the absence of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 results in the cell-surface expression of monocyte/macrophage-specific markers, suggesting that ligand-modulated transcriptional induction of the p21 gene facilitates the induced differentiation of this monoblastic cell line. We believe that this is the first report demonstrating that the ectopic overexpression of a Cdk inhibitor such as p21 or p27 directly leads to a terminal differentiation program.},

	Abstract = {We reported previously that the induced differentiation of the myelomonocytic cell line U937 by vitamin D3 is facilitated by the transcriptional induction of the p21(WAF1/CIP1) gene by the vitamin D3 receptor (Liu, M., Lee, M.-H., Cohen, M., and Freedman, L. P. (1996) Genes Dev. 10, 143-153). Retinoic acid (RA), a physiological metabolite of vitamin A, is also a potent inducer of differentiation of several cell types, including myeloid leukemic cells. Like vitamin D3, RA acts through a subfamily of nuclear hormone receptors, RARs and RXRs (retinoid X receptors), which regulate the expression of target genes by binding to specific DNA elements and modulating transcription initiation. In this report we demonstrate that the gene encoding p21 is also a RA-responsive target gene, and we describe a functional RA response element in this gene's promoter which is required to confer RA induction through RAR.RXR heterodimers. These results correlate the RA induction of monocytic differentiation of U937 cells with the transcriptional activation of the p21 gene and suggest a role for this cyclin/cyclin-dependent kinase complex inhibitor in facilitating this differentiation pathway.},

	Abstract = {PU.1 directs the hematopoietic stem cell to the lymphoid-myeloid progenitor (LMP) and interacts with GATA-binding protein 1 to inhibit commitment to the megakaryocyte-erythroid progenitor. The CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP)alpha then directs the LMP to the granulocyte-monocyte progenitor (GMP) stage, while inhibiting lymphoid development via cross-inhibition of Pax5 and potentially other regulators. Increased PU.1 activity favors monocytic commitment of the GMP. Induction of PU.1 by C/EBPalpha and interaction of PU.1 with c-Jun elevates PU.1 activity. Zippering of C/EBPalpha with c-Jun or c-Fos also contributes to monocyte lineage specification. An additional factor, potentially an Id1-regulated basic helix-loop-helix protein, may be required for the GMP to commit to the granulocyte lineage. Egr-1, Egr-2, Vitamin D Receptor, MafB/c: Fos and PU.1:interferon regulatory factor 8 complexes direct further monocytic maturation, while retinoic acid receptor (RAR) and C/EBPepsilon direct granulopoiesis. Both C/EBPalpha and RARs induce C/EBPepsilon, and PU.1 is also required, albeit at lower levels, for granulocytic maturation. HoxA10 and CAAT displacement protein act as transcriptional repressors to delay expression of terminal differentiation. Gfi-1 and Egr-1,2/Nab2 complexes repress each other to maintain myeloid lineage fidelity. NF-kappaB directly binds and cooperates with C/EBPbeta to induce the inflammatory response in mature myeloid cells and potentially also cooperates with C/EBPalpha to regulate early myelopoiesis.},

	Abstract = {Small changes in the concentrations and/or combinations of trans-acting factors can result in profound alterations in gene expression. Synergistic interaction between different classes of transcription factors bound to distinct sites within a promoter/enhancer region is one mechanism by which this can occur. Reflecting this, hormone response elements, DNA recognition sites for steroid/nuclear receptors, are often found in promoter regions organized as multiple copies or are clustered among binding sites for other trans-acting factors. To systematically examine the potential interactions between one such receptor, the vitamin D3 receptor (VDR), and other nonreceptor transcription factors, we constructed a series of reporter plasmids containing one copy of the osteopontin (Spp1) vitamin D response element (VDRE), consisting of two direct repeats spaced by 3 base pairs, and one binding site for the transcription factors SP1, NF-1, Oct-1, or AP-1. We also generated reporters either under the control of two copies of Spp1 VDRE, or a distinct VDRE from the human osteocalcin gene promoter. The various reporters were used to transiently transfect HeLa or CV-1 cells in the presence and absence of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3. Our results show that VDR transactivates 12-20 times more strongly from two Spp1-VDREs than from one, indicating that VDR synergizes with itself. VDR also synergizes with the other nonreceptor factors, since we observe a 6- to 12-fold degree of synergistic induction after ligand addition, depending on the particular factor. The functional basis for the transcriptional synergism appears to be at the level of cooperative DNA binding, at least for VDR alone and VDR-Oct-1, as demonstrated in vitro by gel mobility shift assays using purified factors. Consistent with this, we show that the minimal requirement for transcriptional synergism in vivo by VDR is its DNA-binding domain.},

	Abstract = {The activation antigen CD38, which has NAD+ glycohydrolase activity in its extracellular domain, is expressed by a large variety of cell types. Few investigations into the regulation of CD38 expression by physiologic stimuli have been reported. As the CD38 promoter contains potential binding sites for interferon (IFN) regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1), we investigated the influence of IFN type I (alpha and beta) and type II (gamma) on CD38 gene expression of leukemic B cells. Using the IFN-responsive B cell line Eskol, we found by RT-PCR analysis a rapid time-dependent induction in CD38 mRNA (starting at 6 h) with each type of IFN. This induction was independent of protein synthesis, suggesting that CD38 gene activation does not require IRF-1 but is merely under direct transcriptional regulation by latent IFN-inducible factors. mRNA stimulation was followed within 24 h by induction of membrane CD38, which coincided with rises of CD38-specific ectoenzymatic activities, that is, NAD+ glycohydrolase, (A/G)DP-ribosyl cyclase, and cyclic ADP ribose hydrolase activities. IFN failed to induce or upregulate the other CD38-related ectoenzymes analyzed, that is, CD39, CD73, CD157, and PC-1. Similarly, treatment of leukemic cells of patients with B chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) with IFN resulted in an increase in CD38 mRNA mirrored by plasma membrane upregulation of CD38 and NAD+ glycohydrolase activity. Further investigation in relation to CD38 gene activation and B-CLL behavior remains to be defined.},

@article{Chen2004,
	Abstract = {Advances in differentiation therapy of cancer are likely to depend on improved understanding of molecular events that underlie cell differentiation. We reported recently that cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk)5 and p35Nck5a (p35) are expressed in human leukemia HL60 cells induced to differentiate to monocytes by an exposure to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) (1,25D(3)), form a complex, and this complex has kinase activity (F. Chen and G. P. Studzinski, Blood 2001;97:3763). This laboratory has also provided evidence that the extracellular signal-regulated kinase/mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway is active in the early (24-48 h) stages of HL60 cell differentiation induced by 1,25D(3) but declines in the later, terminal phase of this form of differentiation (X. Wang and G. P. Studzinski, J Cell Biochem 2001;80:471). We examine now the hypothesis that Egr1 protein contributes to the up-regulation of p35 gene transcription and, thus, activated Cdk5/p35 kinase phosphorylates and inactivates mitogen-activated protein/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase 1 (MEK1). Our data show that in 1,25D(3)-treated cells, p35 and Egr1 protein levels are elevated in a dose-dependent manner at the onset of the late stage of differentiation. We show also that 1,25D(3) treatment of HL60 cells markedly increases the binding of Egr1 to an element in the p35 gene promoter, whereas transfection of an excess of this Egr1-binding oligonucleotide ("promoter decoy") reduces p35 gene transcription and cell differentiation. Additionally, Cdk5/p35 phosphorylates MEK1 and inhibits its ability to phosphorylate its downstream target Erk2. These data suggest that in 1,25D(3)-treated HL60 cells, Egr1 up-regulates p35 gene transcription and that Cdk5/p35 kinase inactivates the extracellular signal-regulated kinase/mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway by phosphorylation of MEK1, and this contributes to terminal differentiation of these cells.},

@article{Han2004,
	Abstract = {PURPOSE: The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma), a ligand-dependent transcription factor belonging to the family of nuclear receptors, has been implicated in the regulation of cell growth and differentiation although the exact mechanism(s) of this activity has not been elucidated. In this study, we explored the role of PPARgamma signaling on the control of gene expression of the cycle-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 in human lung carcinoma cells.
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Using several human lung carcinoma cell lines (small and non-small carcinoma cells), we assayed for cell growth inhibition and apoptosis induction. We also assayed for p21 mRNA and protein expression by reverse transcription-PCR, real-time reverse transcription-PCR, and Western blot analysis. Nuclear protein binding activities to three response elements located in the p21 promoter [nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB, Sp1, and NF-interleukin 6 (IL6) CAAT/enhancer binding protein (C/EBP)] were measured by gel mobility shift assays. We used transient transfection assays with p21 promoter reporter gene constructs to determine the transcriptional regulation by PPARgamma ligands. Finally, by using p21 antisense oligonucleotides, we tested the link between PPARgamma activation and p21 signaling in cell growth inhibition assays and by Western blot analysis.
RESULTS: We showed that the PPARgamma ligands PGJ2 and ciglitazone inhibit the growth and induce the apoptosis of several human lung carcinoma cell lines, whereas the PPARalpha agonist WY14643 has little effect. Treatment of lung carcinoma cells with the PPARgamma ligands PGJ2, ciglitazone, troglizaone, and GW1929 elevated p21 mRNA and protein levels and reduced cyclin D1 mRNA levels. These results were supported by transient transfection assays, which indicated that PPARgamma ligands increased p21 gene promoter activity in human lung carcinoma cells. In addition, p21 antisense oligonucleotides inhibited PPARgamma ligand-induced p21 protein expression and significantly blocked lung carcinoma cell growth inhibition induced by PPARgamma ligands. Finally, electrophoresis mobility shift experiments demonstrated that PPARgamma ligands increased the nuclear binding activities of Sp1 and NF-IL6 (C/EBP), two transcription factors with regulatory elements in the promoter region of the p21 gene.
CONCLUSION: PPARgamma ligands inhibit human lung carcinoma cell growth and induce apoptosis by stimulating the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 and by reducing cyclin D1 gene expression. The induction of p21 gene expression by PPARgamma ligands may be mediated through increased Sp1- and NF-IL6 (C/EBP)-dependent transcriptional activation. These observations unveil a mechanism for p21 gene regulation in lung carcinoma that represents a potential target for therapy.},

	Abstract = {Retinoids (natural and synthetic derivatives of vitamin A) signal potent differentiation and growth-suppressive effects in diverse normal, premalignant, and malignant cells. A strong rationale exists for the use of retinoids in cancer treatment and chemoprevention based on preclinical, epidemiological, and early clinical findings. Despite the success of all-trans-retinoic acid (RA)-based differentiation therapy in acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), the broad promise of retinoids in the clinic has not yet been realized. In addition to the expected limited activity of any single therapeutic agent, translation of retinoid activities from the laboratory to the clinic has met with intrinsic or acquired retinoid resistance. Evidence suggests that solid tumors develop intrinsic resistance to retinoids during carcinogenesis. In contrast, relapse of APL is often associated with acquired resistance to retinoid maturation induction. This review discusses what is known about retinoid resistance mechanisms in cancer therapy and chemoprevention. Strategies to overcome this resistance will be discussed, including combination therapy with other differentiation-inducing, cytotoxic or chromatin-remodeling agents, as well as the use of receptor-selective and nonclassical retinoids. Opportunities exist in the post-genomic era to bypass resistance to classical retinoids by identifying target genes and associated pathways that directly mediate the antineoplastic effects of retinoids. In this regard, the retinoids are useful pharmacological tools to reveal important pathways targeted in cancer therapy and chemoprevention.},

Courses of chemotherapy were given throughout the study. In September 1982, marrow promyelocytes markedly increased, making up 51% of the nucleated cells. One month later the situation was unchanged, and 13-cis-retinoic acid (1 mg/kg) was administered by mouth. Gradually the marrow proportion of promyelocytes decreased to normal levels. The peripheral blood and marrow were still normal after 20 weeks of treatment with retinoic acid.

A better understanding of how genetic variants influence vitamin D status should not only improve cancer risk predictions, but also promote the development of vitamin D analogs with more specific actions to improve therapeutic outcomes.},

	Abstract = {Retinoids (i.e., vitamin A, all-trans retinoic acid, and related signaling molecules) induce the differentiation of various types of stem cells. Nuclear retinoic acid receptors mediate most but not all of the effects of retinoids. Retinoid signaling is often compromised early in carcinogenesis, which suggests that a reduction in retinoid signaling may be required for tumor development. Retinoids interact with other signaling pathways, including estrogen signaling in breast cancer. Retinoids are used to treat cancer, in part because of their ability to induce differentiation and arrest proliferation. Delivery of retinoids to patients is challenging because of the rapid metabolism of some retinoids and because epigenetic changes can render cells retinoid resistant. Successful cancer therapy with retinoids is likely to require combination therapy with drugs that regulate the epigenome, such as DNA methyltransferase and histone deacetylase inhibitors, as well as classical chemotherapeutic agents. Thus, retinoid research benefits both cancer prevention and cancer treatment.},

	Abstract = {The retinoids are a class of compounds that are structurally related to vitamin A. Retinoic acid, which is the active metabolite of retinol, regulates a wide range of biological processes including development, differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis. Retinoids exert their effects through a variety of binding proteins including cellular retinol-binding protein (CRBP), retinol-binding proteins (RBP), cellular retinoic acid-binding protein (CRABP), and nuclear receptors i.e. retinoic acid receptor (RAR) and retinoid x receptor (RXR). Because of the pleiotropic effects of retinoids, understanding the function of these binding proteins and nuclear receptors assists us in developing compounds that have specific effects. This review summarizes our current understanding of how retinoids are processed and act with an emphasis on the application of retinoids in cancer treatment and prevention.},

Gene expression is entirely based on the endogenous translation components and transcription machinery provided by an E. coli cytoplasmic extract, thus expanding the repertoire of regulatory parts to hundreds of elements. We use a powerful metabolism for ATP regeneration to achieve more than 2 mg/mL of protein synthesis in batch mode reactions, and more than 6 mg/mL in semicontinuous mode. While the strength of cell-free expression is increased by a factor of 3 on average, the output signal of simple gene circuits and the synthesis of entire bacteriophages are increased by orders of magnitude compared to previous results. Messenger RNAs and protein degradation, respectively tuned using E. coli MazF interferase and ClpXP AAA+ proteases, are characterized over a much wider range of rates than the first version of the cell-free toolbox. This system is a highly versatile cell-free platform to construct complex biological systems through the execution of DNA programs composed of synthetic and natural bacterial regulatory parts.},

	Abstract = {Constraints-based models for microbial metabolism can currently be constructed on a genome-scale. These models do not account for RNA and protein synthesis. A scalable formalism to describe translation and transcription that can be integrated with the existing metabolic models is thus needed. Here, we developed such a formalism. The fundamental protein synthesis network described by this formalism was analysed via extreme pathway and flux balance analyses. The protein synthesis network exhibited one extreme pathway per messenger RNA synthesized and one extreme pathway per protein synthesized. The key parameters in this network included promoter strengths, messenger RNA half-lives, and the availability of nucleotide triphosphates, amino acids, RNA polymerase, and active ribosomes. Given these parameters, we were able to calculate a cell's material and energy expenditures for protein synthesis using a flux balance approach. The framework provided herein can subsequently be integrated with genome-scale metabolic models, providing a sequence-based accounting of the metabolic demands resulting from RNA and protein polymerization.},

This updated metabolic reconstruction includes: (1) an alignment with the latest genome annotation and the metabolic content of EcoCyc leading to the inclusion of the activities of 1260 ORFs, (2) characterization and quantification of the biomass components and maintenance requirements associated with growth of E. coli and (3) thermodynamic information for the included chemical reactions. The conversion of this metabolic network reconstruction into an in silico model is detailed. A new step in the metabolic reconstruction process, termed thermodynamic consistency analysis, is introduced, in which reactions were checked for consistency with thermodynamic reversibility estimates. Applications demonstrating the capabilities of the genome-scale metabolic model to predict high-throughput experimental growth and gene deletion phenotypic screens are presented. The increased scope and computational capability using this new reconstruction is expected to broaden the spectrum of both basic biology and applied systems biology studies of E. coli metabolism.},

	Abstract = {Transcription factors that drive non-neoplastic myelomonocytic differentiation are well characterized but have not been systematically analyzed in the leukemic context. We investigated widely used, patient-derived myeloid leukemia cell lines with proclivity for differentiation into granulocytes by retinoic acid (RA) and/or monocytes by 1,25-dihyrdroxyvitamin D3 (D3). Using K562 (FAB M1), HL60 (FAB M2), RA-resistant HL60 sublines, NB4 (FAB M3), and U937 (FAB M5), we correlated nuclear transcription factor expression to immunophenotype, G1/G0 cell cycle arrest and functional inducible oxidative metabolism. We found that myelomonocytic transcription factors are aberrantly expressed in these cell lines. Monocytic-lineage factor EGR1 was not induced by D3 (the monocytic inducer) but instead by RA (the granulocytic inducer) in lineage bipotent myeloblastic HL60. In promyelocytic NB4 cells, EGR1 levels were increased by D3, while Gfi-1 expression (which promotes the granulocytic lineage) was upregulated during D3-induced monocytic differentiation in HL60, and by RA treatment in monocytic U937 cells. Furthermore, RARα and VDR expression were not strongly correlated to differentiation. In response to different differentiation inducers, U937 exhibited the most distinct transcription factor expression profile, while similarly mature NB4 and HL60 were better coupled. Overall, the differentiation induction agents RA and D3 elicited cell-specific responses across these common FAB M1-M5 cell lines.},

	Abstract = {The role that mechanistic mathematical modeling and systems biology will play in molecular medicine and clinical development remains uncertain. In this study, mathematical modeling and sensitivity analysis were used to explore the working hypothesis that mechanistic models of human cascades, despite model uncertainty, can be computationally screened for points of fragility, and that these sensitive mechanisms could serve as therapeutic targets. We tested our working hypothesis by screening a model of the well-studied coagulation cascade, developed and validated from literature. The predicted sensitive mechanisms were then compared with the treatment literature. The model, composed of 92 proteins and 148 protein-protein interactions, was validated using 21 published datasets generated from two different quiescent in vitro coagulation models. Simulated platelet activation and thrombin generation profiles in the presence and absence of natural anticoagulants were consistent with measured values, with a mean correlation of 0.87 across all trials. Overall state sensitivity coefficients, which measure the robustness or fragility of a given mechanism, were calculated using a Monte Carlo strategy. In the absence of anticoagulants, fluid and surface phase factor X/activated factor X (fX/FXa) activity and thrombin-mediated platelet activation were found to be fragile, while fIX/FIXa and fVIII/FVIIIa activation and activity were robust. Both anti-fX/FXa and direct thrombin inhibitors are important classes of anticoagulants; for example, anti-fX/FXa inhibitors have FDA approval for the prevention of venous thromboembolism following surgical intervention and as an initial treatment for deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. Both in vitro and in vivo experimental evidence is reviewed supporting the prediction that fIX/FIXa activity is robust. When taken together, these results support our working hypothesis that computationally derived points of fragility of human relevant cascades could be used as a rational basis for target selection despite model uncertainty.},

	Abstract = {We propose a mathematical model for mitochondria-dependent apoptosis, in which kinetic cooperativity in formation of the apoptosome is a key element ensuring bistability. We examine the role of Bax and Bcl-2 synthesis and degradation rates, as well as the number of mitochondrial permeability transition pores (MPTPs), on the cell response to apoptotic stimuli. Our analysis suggests that cooperative apoptosome formation is a mechanism for inducing bistability, much more robust than that induced by other mechanisms, such as inhibition of caspase-3 by the inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP). Simulations predict a pathological state in which cells will exhibit a monostable cell survival if Bax degradation rate is above a threshold value, or if Bax expression rate is below a threshold value. Otherwise, cell death or survival occur depending on initial caspase-3 levels. We show that high expression rates of Bcl-2 can counteract the effects of Bax. Our simulations also demonstrate a monostable (pathological) apoptotic response if the number of MPTPs exceeds a threshold value. This study supports our contention, based on mathematical modeling, that cooperativity in apoptosome formation is critically important for determining the healthy responses to apoptotic stimuli, and helps define the roles of Bax, Bcl-2, and MPTP vis-{\`a}-vis apoptosome formation.},

Crucial mediators of Xenopus oocyte maturation, including the p42 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and the cell-division cycle protein kinase Cdc2, are known to be organized into positive feedback loops. In principle, such positive feedback loops could produce an actively maintained 'memory' of a transient inductive stimulus and could explain the irreversibility of maturation. Here we show that the p42 MAPK and Cdc2 system normally generates an irreversible biochemical response from a transient stimulus, but the response becomes transient when positive feedback is blocked. Our results explain how a group of intrinsically reversible signal transducers can generate an irreversible response at a systems level, and show how a cell fate can be maintained by a self-sustaining pattern of protein kinase activation.},

	Abstract = {We have used HL-60 leukemia cells to investigate phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-K) during granulocytic differentiation at the nuclear level. Nuclei of HL-60 cells showed a constitutive presence of PI 3-K that increased when cells were treated with differentiating doses of ATRA. PI 3-K was also detected tightly bound to nuclear matrices of HL-60 cells, isolated by nuclease treatment and high salt extraction. Four days of ATRA treatment induced a striking increase of nuclear matrix bound PI 3-K. In situ morphological analysis by confocal microscopy showed the translocation of PI 3-K to the nucleus and to the subnuclear fractions. PI 3-K enzymatic activity was stimulated during the granulocytic differentiation process and parallelled the increase in content of nuclei and subnuclear fractions. PI 3-K activity was recovered in nuclei also without the addition of exogenous substrates, consistent with the presence of both substrates and enzyme in the nucleus. These results indicate that specific intracellular localization of PI 3-K determines the production of different phosphoinositides in the sites of the enzyme translocation, and suggest that 3-phosphoinositide metabolism may play a specific role in the nucleus, candidating PI 3-K as a key enzyme in promoting granulocytic differentiation of HL-60 cells.},

@article{Shen:2011aa,
	Abstract = {All-trans retinoic acid (RA) and interferons (IFNs) have efficacy in treating certain leukemias and lymphomas, respectively, motivating interest in their mechanism of action to improve therapy. Both RA and IFNs induce interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1). We find that in HL-60 myeloblastic leukemia cells which undergo mitogen activated protien kinase (MAPK)-dependent myeloid differentiation in response to RA, IRF-1 propels differentiation. RA induces MAPK-dependent expression of IRF-1. IRF-1 binds c-Cbl, a MAPK related adaptor. Ectopic IRF-1 expression causes CD38 expression and activation of the Raf/MEK/ERK axis, and enhances RA-induced differentiation by augmenting CD38, CD11b, respiratory burst and G0 arrest. Ectopic IRF-1 expression also decreases the activity of aldehyde dehydrogenase 1, a stem cell marker, and enhances RA-induced ALDH1 down-regulation. Interestingly, expression of aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), which is RA-induced and known to down-regulate Oct4 and drive RA-induced differentiation, also enhances IRF-1 expression. The data are consistent with a model whereby IRF-1 acts downstream of RA and AhR to enhance Raf/MEK/ERK activation and propel differentiation.},

@article{Asthagiri2001,
	Abstract = {Exploiting signaling pathways for the purpose of controlling cell
	function entails identifying and manipulating the information content
	of intracellular signals. As in the case of the ubiquitously expressed,
	eukaryotic mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway,
	this information content partly resides in the signals' dynamical
	properties. Here, we utilize a mathematical model to examine mechanisms
	that govern MAPK pathway dynamics, particularly the role of putative
	negative feedback mechanisms in generating complete signal adaptation,
	a term referring to the reset of a signal to prestimulation levels.
	In addition to yielding adaptation of its direct target, feedback
	mechanisms implemented in our model also indirectly assist in the
	adaptation of signaling components downstream of the target under
	certain conditions. In fact, model predictions identify conditions
	yielding ultra-desensitization of signals in which complete adaptation
	of target and downstream signals culminates even while stimulus recognition
	(i.e., receptor-ligand binding) continues to increase. Moreover,
	the rate at which signal decays can follow first-order kinetics with
	respect to signal intensity, so that signal adaptation is achieved
	in the same amount of time regardless of signal intensity or ligand
	dose. All of these features are consistent with experimental findings
	recently obtained for the Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell lines
	(Asthagiri et al., J. Biol. Chem. 1999, 274, 27119-27127). Our model
	further predicts that although downstream effects are independent
	of whether an enzyme or adaptor protein is targeted by negative feedback,
	adaptor-targeted feedback can "back-propagate" effects upstream of
	the target, specifically resulting in increased steady-state upstream
	signal. Consequently, where these upstream components serve as nodes
	within a signaling network, feedback can transfer signaling through
	these nodes into alternate pathways, thereby promoting the sort of
	signaling cross-talk that is becoming more widely appreciated.},

@article{Balk2008,
	Abstract = {The androgen receptor (AR) is a critical effector of prostate cancer
	development and progression. The dependence of this tumor type on
	AR activity is exploited in treatment of disseminated prostate cancers,
	wherein ablation of AR function (achieved either through ligand depletion
	and/or the use of AR antagonists) is the first line of therapeutic
	intervention. These strategies are initially effective, and induce
	a mixed response of cell cycle arrest or apoptosis in prostate cancer
	cells. However, recurrent, incurable tumors ultimately arise as a
	result of inappropriately restored AR function. Based on these observations,
	it is imperative to define the mechanisms by which AR controls cancer
	cell proliferation. Mechanistic investigation has revealed that AR
	acts as a master regulator of G1-S phase progression, able to induce
	signals that promote G1 cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) activity, induce
	phosphorylation/inactivation of the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor
	(RB), and thereby govern androgen-dependent proliferation. These
	functions appear to be independent of the recently identified TMPRSS2-ETS
	fusions. Once engaged, several components of the cell cycle machinery
	actively modulate AR activity throughout the cell cycle, thus indicating
	that crosstalk between the AR and cell cycle pathways likely modulate
	the mitogenic response to androgen. As will be discussed, discrete
	aberrations in this process can alter the proliferative response
	to androgen, and potentially subvert hormonal control of tumor progression.},

	Abstract = {Retinoids are known to induce the differentiation and cell cycle arrest
	of human myeloid leukemia cells in vitro. Differential display was
	used to identify putative early regulatory genes that are differentially
	expressed in HL-60 human promyelocytic leukemia cells treated with
	retinoic acid. One of the cDNAs cloned encodes sequences identifying
	Burkitt's lymphoma receptor 1 (BLR1), a recently described chemokine
	receptor. Northern blot analysis demonstrates that blr1 mRNA expression
	increases within 9 h of retinoic acid treatment, well before functional
	differentiation or G(1)/G(0) growth arrest at 48 h or onset of morphological
	changes, suggesting a possible regulatory function. The expression
	of blr1 mRNA is transient, peaking at 72 h when cells are differentiated.
	blr1 mRNA also is induced by other differentiation-inducing agents,
	1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) and DMSO. Induction of blr1 mRNA
	by retinoic acid is not blocked by the protein synthesis inhibitor
	cycloheximide. In HL-60 cells stably transfected with blr1 cDNA,
	ectopic expression of blr1 causes an increase in ERK2 MAPK activation

	differentiation. The early expression of blr1 mRNA during differentiation,

	Abstract = {Upstream signaling requirements of retinoic acid (RA)-induced blr1
	expression and downstream signaling consequences of blr1 over-expression
	in a human myeloid leukemia cell line demonstrate that mitogen-activated
	protein kinase (MAPK) signaling complexes are involved in both avenues.
	RA-induced myeloid differentiation and G1/G0 growth arrest of HL-60
	cells is known to require the activation of the RARalpha and RXR
	retinoid receptors, as well as activation of the MAPK, ERK2. Transcriptional
	activation of the Burkitt's lymphoma receptor 1 (blr1) gene occurs
	early during RA-induced differentiation of HL-60 cells and requires
	these same three activating processes. The use of retinoid ligands
	that activate either the RARalpha or the RXR retinoid receptors revealed
	that blr1 mRNA induction was detectable only when both RARalpha and
	RXR were activated. Neither the RARalpha nor RXR selective ligands
	alone induced expression of blr1, but the combination of the two
	ligands induced the expression of blr1 to the same extent as RA.
	The MAPKK (MEK) inhibitor, PD98059, was used to determine whether
	extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK2) activation was necessary
	for induction of blr1 mRNA. PD98059 inhibited induced blr1 mRNA expression,
	due to RA or activated RARalpha plus RXR ligands, indicating that
	ERK2 activation is necessary for blr1 mRNA expression. Previous studies
	showed that ectopic expression of blr1 also caused increased MAPK
	activation, in particular ERK2, and subsequently accelerated RA-induced
	differentiation and G1/G0 growth arrest. Inhibition of ERK2 activation
	inhibited differentiation of blr1 transfectants, suggesting that
	the accelerated differentiation reflected blr1-enhanced ERK2 activation.
	The present data also demonstrate that ectopic expression of blr1
	increased JNK/SAPK activity, but JNK/ SAPK activation was not needed
	for accelerated RA-induced differentiation and growth arrest. The
	results show that the signals known to be required for HL-60 differentiation,
	activated RARalpha, RXR, and ERK2, are necessary for blr1 mRNA expression.
	Downstream consequences of blr1 overexpression include enhanced MAPK
	signaling.},

	1,2/protein kinase C (PKC) system is one such network that regulates
	many cellular machines, including the cell cycle machinery and autocrine/paracrine

	the design principles of this controller network. We find that the

	can operate with one (monostable) or two (bistable) stable states.
	At low concentrations of MAPK phosphatase, the system exhibits bistable
	behavior, such that brief stimulus results in sustained MAPK activation.
	The MAPK-induced increase in the amounts of MAPK phosphatase eliminates
	the prolonged response capability and moves the network to a monostable
	state, in which it behaves as a proportional response system responding
	acutely to stimulus. Thus, the MAPK 1, 2/PKC controller network is
	flexibly designed, and MAPK phosphatase may be critical for this

	Abstract = {We have examined the possible mechanisms of resistance to the epidermal
	growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors in tumor cells with variable
	levels of EGFR. ZD1839 (Iressa) is a small-molecular-weight, ATP-mimetic
	that specifically inhibits the EGFR tyrosine kinase. A431 cell growth
	was markedly inhibited by ZD1839 (IC(50)< or =0.1 microM) whereas
	the MDA-468 cells were relatively resistant (IC(50)2 microM). Low
	doses of ZD1839 delayed cell cycle progression and induced apoptosis
	in A431 cells but not in MDA-468 cells. In both cell lines, 0.1 microM
	ZD1839 eliminated EGFR phosphorylation. However, the basal activity
	of the phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3 K) target Akt was eliminated
	in A431 but not in MDA-468 cells, implying that their Akt activity
	is independent of EGFR signals. A431 cells express PTEN/MMAC1/TEP,
	a phosphatase that can dephosphorylate position D3 of phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5
	trisphosphate, the site that recruits the plecstrin-homology domain
	of Akt to the cell membrane. On the contrary, MDA-468 cells lack
	the phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), potentially setting Akt
	activity at a high threshold that is unresponsive to EGFR inhibition
	alone. Therefore, we reintroduced (PTEN) by retroviral infection
	in MDA-468 cells. In MDA-468/PTEN but not in vector controls, treatment
	with ZD1839 inhibited P-Akt levels, induced relocalization of the
	Forkhead factor FKHRL1 to the cell nucleus, and increased FKHRL1-dependent
	transcriptional activity. ZD1839 induced a greater degree of apoptosis
	and cell cycle delay in PTEN-reconstituted than in control cells.
	These data suggest that loss of PTEN, by permitting a high level
	of Akt activity independent of receptor tyrosine kinase inputs, can
	temporally dissociate the inhibition of the EGFR with that of Akt
	induced by EGFR inhibitors. Thus, in EGFR-expressing tumor cells
	with concomitant amplification(s) of PI3K-Akt signaling, combined
	blockade of the EGFR tyrosine kinase and Akt should be considered
	as a therapeutic approach.},

	model complex networked systems is key to understanding them, an
	open problem in many disciplines. Here we introduce for the first

	for a nonlinear coupled dynamical system directly from time series
	data. This method is applicable to any system that can be described

	that the (possibly noisy) time series of all variables are observable.
	Previous automated symbolic modeling approaches of coupled physical
	systems produced linear models or required a nonlinear model to be

	allowing the method to model each (possibly coupled) variable separately,
	intelligently perturbing and destabilizing the system to extract
	its less observable characteristics, and automatically simplifying
	the equations during modeling. We demonstrate this method on four

	Abstract = {The HL-60 cell line, derived from a patient with acute promyelocytic
	leukemia, proliferates continuously in suspension culture and consists
	predominantly (greater than 90\%) of promyelocytes. These cells can
	be induced to differentiate to morphologically and functionally mature
	granulocytes by incubation with a wide variety of compounds, including
	butyrate and hypoxanthine and polar planar compounds such as dimethyl
	sulfoxide and hexamethylene bisacetamide. We have now found that
	retinoic acid (all-trans-retinoic acid) induces differentiation (as
	measured morphologically and by the ability to reduce nitroblue tetrazolium)
	of HL-60 at concentrations as low as 1 nM. Maximal differentiation
	(approximately 90\%) occurs at 1 micro M, a concentration 1/500th
	to 1/160,000th the concentrations of butyrate (0.5 mM) and dimethyl
	sulfoxide (160 mM) that promote a similar increase in differentiation.
	Continuous exposure to retinoic acid is necessary for optimal differentiation,
	with the percentage of mature cells in the culture directly related
	to the length of time of exposure to retinoic acid. Retinoic acid
	and 13-cis-retinoic acid are equally effective in inducing differentiation
	of HL-60. Retinol (vitamin A), retinal, and retinyl acetate are approximately
	1/1000th less potent. This study suggests that retinoids could provide
	a therapeutic tool in the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia, a
	disease that has been looked upon as primarily involving a block
	in myeloid differentiation, and indicates that retinoids, in addition
	to their well-characterized involvement in epithelial cell differentiation,
	may also be involved in the differentiation of certain hematopoietic

	Abstract = {Androgens play a crucial role in several stages of male development
	and in the maintenance of the male phenotype. Androgens act in their
	target cells via an interaction with the androgen receptor, resulting
	in direct regulation of gene expression. The androgen receptor is
	a phosphoprotein and modulation of the phosphorylation status of
	the receptor influences ligand-binding and consequently transcription
	activation of androgen responsive genes. Androgen binding induces
	a conformational change in the ligand-binding domain, accompanied
	by additional receptor phosphorylation. Subsequently the liganded
	androgen receptor interacts with specific androgen response elements
	in the regulatory regions of androgen target genes, resulting in
	stimulation of gene expression. Anti-androgens induce a different
	conformational change of the ligand-binding domain, which does not
	or only partially result in stimulation of transactivation. Interestingly,
	different anti-androgens can induce different inactive conformations
	of the androgen receptor ligand-binding domain. Recent evidence strongly
	supports a ligand dependent functional interaction between the ligand-binding
	domain and the NH2-terminal transactivating domain of the androgen
	receptor. Two regions in the NH2-terminal domain are involved in
	this interaction, whereas in the ligand-binding domain the AF-2 AD
	core region is involved.},

	Abstract = {The ability of subtypes of retinoic acid receptors (RARs) and retinoid
	X receptors (RXRs) singly and in combination to elicit myeloid differentiation,
	G1/0-specific growth arrest, and retinoblastoma (RB) tumor suppressor
	protein dephosphorylation was determined in the human myeloblastic
	leukemia cell line HL-60 using subtype-selective retinoic acid (RA)
	analogs. RA analogs that selectively bind only to RARs (Am580 and/or
	TTNPB) or to RXRs (Ro 25-6603, SR11237, and/or SR11234) did not elicit
	the above-mentioned three cellular responses. In contrast, simultaneous
	treatment with both an RAR-selective ligand (Am580 or TTNPB) and
	an RXR-selective ligand (Ro 25-6603, SR11237, or SR11234) induced
	all three cellular processes. An RAR alpha-selective ligand used
	with an RXR-selective ligand generated the same responses as did
	all-trans RA or 9-cis RA, which affect both families of receptors,
	suggesting an important role for RAR alpha among RAR subtypes in
	eliciting cellular response. Consistent with this finding, the RAR
	alpha antagonist, Ro 41-5253, reduced the level of the cellular responses
	elicited by treatment with an RAR alpha-selective ligand plus RXR-selective
	ligand. The coupling of the shift of RB to its hypophosphorylated

	is consistent with a possible role of RB as a downstream target or

	Abstract = {Cyclin D1 is a multifaceted regulator of both transcription and cell-cycle
	progression that exists in two distinct isoforms, cyclin D1a and
	D1b. In the prostate, cyclin D1a acts through discrete mechanisms
	to negatively regulate androgen receptor (AR) activity and thus limit
	androgen-dependent proliferation. Accordingly, cyclin D1a is rarely
	overexpressed in prostatic adenocarcinoma and holds little prognostic
	value in this tumor type. However, a common polymorphism (A870) known
	to facilitate production of cyclin D1b is associated with increased
	prostate cancer risk. Here we show that cyclin D1b is expressed at
	high frequency in prostate cancer and is up-regulated in neoplastic
	disease. Furthermore, our data demonstrate that, although cyclin
	D1b retains AR association, it is selectively compromised for AR
	regulation. The altered ability of cyclin D1b to regulate the AR
	was observed by using both in vitro and in vivo assays and was associated
	with compromised regulation of AR-dependent proliferation. Consistent
	with previous reports, expression of cyclin D1a inhibited cell-cycle
	progression in AR-dependent prostate cancer cells. Strikingly, cyclin
	D1b significantly stimulated proliferation in this cell type. AR-negative
	prostate cancer cells were nonresponsive to cyclin D1 (a or b) expression,
	indicating that defects in AR corepressor function yield a growth
	advantage specifically in AR-dependent cells. In summary, these studies
	indicate that the altered AR regulatory capacity of cyclin D1b contributes
	to its association with increased prostate cancer risk and provide
	evidence of cyclin D1b-mediated transcriptional regulation.},

	systems and ultimately to develop predictive models of human disease.
	Although meaningful molecular level models of human cell and tissue

	measurements ('omics') dramatically accelerate hypothesis generation
	and testing in disease models. Computer simulations integrating knowledge

	clinical trials. Automation of complex primary human cell-based assay

	Abstract = {PURPOSE: Overexpression of the epidermal growth factor receptor has
	been demonstrated in advanced prostate cancer and is associated with
	a poor outcome. A multi-institutional, randomized, phase II study
	was undertaken by the National Cancer Institute of Canada-Clinical
	Trials Group to evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of two doses of
	oral gefitinib in patients with minimally symptomatic, hormone-refractory
	prostate cancer (HRPC). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between July and November
	2001, 40 patients with HRPC and increasing prostate-specific antigen
	(PSA) or progression in measurable disease who had not received prior
	chemotherapy were randomly assigned to 250 mg (n = 19) or 500 mg
	(n = 21) oral gefitinib daily continuously. The primary end points
	were PSA response rate and objective measurable response. Functional
	Assessment of Cancer Therapy Prostate Cancer Subscale (FACT-P) quality-of-life
	questionnaires were completed at baseline and during treatment. RESULTS:
	None of the patients demonstrated a PSA or objective measurable response.
	Five (14.3\%) of 35 assessable patients had stable PSA (one patient
	at 250 mg and four patients at 500 mg), and five patients (14.3\%)
	had a best response of stable disease (duration, 2.5 to 16.8 months).
	No significant effect on the rate of increase in PSA was seen. The
	most common drug-related nonhematologic toxicities observed were
	grade 1 to 2 diarrhea (250 mg, 65\%; 500 mg, 56\%), fatigue (250
	mg, 29\%; 500 mg, 33\%), and grade 1 to 2 skin rash (250 mg, 24\%;
	500 mg, 39\%). FACT-P scores decreased during treatment, indicating
	worsening of symptoms compared with baseline. CONCLUSION: Gefitinib
	did not result in any responses in PSA or objective measurable disease
	at either dose level. Gefitinib has minimal single-agent activity
	in HRPC.},

	Abstract = {Despite evidence implicating the insulin-like growth factor (IGF)
	system in the pathogenesis of prostate cancer, its precise role remains
	unclear. In this study we investigated the differential expression
	of IGF-I, IGF-II and their type I receptor (IGFR-I) in the epithelium
	and stroma of prostate neoplastic tissues. Using immunohistochemistry
	and in situ hybridization techniques, we analyzed 43 paraffin-embedded
	prostatic samples and compared prostatic cancer (Pca) with prostatic
	intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) and its normal adjacent prostate
	(NAP) counterpart. We then determined a possible correlation of the
	immunohistochemical and in situ findings with two known prognostic
	clinical-pathological indices: Gleason score histological tumor grade
	and TNM clinical stage. In 22 of the 43 frozen prostatectomy specimens,
	IGF-I, IGF-II and IGFR-I mRNA expression were also evaluated by semiquantitative
	RT-PCR. Non neoplastic and neoplastic tissues examined contained
	detectable amounts of epithelial and stromal IGF-I, IGF-II and IGFR-I
	protein and mRNA; all levels increased significantly from normal
	tissue to PIN to Pca. In all three areas examined, IGFR-I expression
	was invariably higher in epithelium than in stroma, whereas expression
	of IGF ligands differed. In normal prostatic tissue, IGF-I and IGF-II
	expression was higher in stroma than in epithelium. Conversely, in
	Pca tissue, both factors were more strongly expressed in epithelial
	malignant cells. PIN areas showed IGF-I lowest, and IGF-II and IGFR-I
	levels highest in the epithelium. IGF-II protein and mRNA reached
	their highest levels in prostate tumors with high Gleason scores.
	These findings indicate that the IGF system changes as prostate tissue
	progresses from a normal to a malignant state. Differential expression
	of certain IGF system components in Pca may be associated with the
	malignant phenotype and more aggressive tumor behavior. Hence IGFs
	could serve to predict the outcome of prostatic cancer.},

	Abstract = {Among the topoisomerase (topo) II isozymes (alpha and beta), topo
	IIbeta has been suggested to regulate differentiation. In this study,
	we examined the role of topo IIbeta in all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA)-induced
	differentiation of myeloid leukemia cell lines. Inhibition of topo
	IIbeta activity or downregulation of protein expression enhanced
	ATRA-induced differentiation/growth arrest and apoptosis. ATRA-induced
	apoptosis in topo IIbeta-deficient cells involved activation of the
	caspase cascade and was rescued by ectopic expression of topo IIbeta.
	Gene expression profiling led to the identification of peroxiredoxin
	2 (PRDX2) as a candidate gene that was downregulated in topo IIbeta-deficient
	cells. Reduced expression of PRDX2 validated at the mRNA and protein
	level, in topo IIbeta-deficient cells correlated with increased accumulation
	of reactive oxygen species (ROS) following ATRA-induced differentiation.
	Overexpression of PRDX2 in topo IIbeta-deficient cells led to reduced
	accumulation of ROS and partially reversed ATRA-induced apoptosis.
	These results support a role for topo IIbeta in survival of ATRA-differentiated
	myeloid leukemia cells. Reduced expression of topo IIbeta induces
	apoptosis in part by impairing the anti-oxidant capacity of the cell
	owing to downregulation of PRDX2. Thus, suppression of topo IIbeta
	and/or PRDX2 levels in myeloid leukemia cells provides a novel approach
	for improving ATRA-based differentiation therapy.},

	Abstract = {Raf kinase is a key component in regulating the MAPK pathway. B-Raf
	has been reported as an oncogene and is mutated in 60\% of human
	melanomas. The main focus of Raf regulation studies has been on phosphorylation,
	dephosphorylation, and scaffolding proteins; however, Raf also has
	its own auto-regulatory domain. Removal of the N-terminal regulatory
	domain, initially discovered in the viral Raf oncogene (v-Raf), results
	in a kinase domain with high basal activity independent of Ras activation.
	In this report, we show that activating phosphorylations are still
	required for activity of the truncated C-terminal kinase domain (called
	22W). The interaction between the N-terminal regulatory domain and
	the C-terminal kinase domain is disrupted by activated Ras. Mutations
	in the Ras binding domain, cysteine-rich domain, or S259A do not
	affect the inhibition of 22W by the N-terminal domain. When phosphomimetic
	residues are substituted at the activating sites (DDED) in 22W, this
	results in a higher basal activity that is no longer inhibited by
	expression of the N-terminal domain, although binding to the N-terminal
	domain still occurs. Although the interaction between 22W/DDED and
	the N-terminal domain may be in a different conformation, the interaction
	is still disrupted by activated Ras. These data demonstrate that
	N-terminal domain binding to the kinase domain inhibits the activity
	of the kinase domain. However, this inhibition is relieved when the
	C-terminal kinase domain is activated by phosphorylation.},

	homology 2 (SH2) domains of various signal-transducing molecules.
	In this report, we demonstrate that Raf-1 associated with the SH2
	domain of Fyn (a member of the Src tyrosine kinase family) but not
	with the SH2 domains of phospholipase C-gamma 1, the p85 alpha subunit
	of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and SH2-containing protein tyrosine
	phosphatase 2. Unlike most SH2 domain interactions that require tyrosine-phosphorylated
	residues, the Raf-1/Fyn SH2 domain association was dependent on the
	serine phosphorylation of Raf-1. Our results also demonstrate that
	Raf-1 interacted with the SH2 domain of Src and that this interaction
	was destabilized by mutation of Arg175 found within the conserved
	SH2 domain FLVRES sequence. In addition, we show that inclusion of
	additional Src sequences containing the SH3 domain increased the
	association of Raf-1 with the Src SH2 domain. Finally, using the
	baculovirus/Sf9 cell system, we show that coexpression of Raf-1 with
	full-length Fyn/Src resulted in the coimmunoprecipitation of Raf-1
	with Fyn/Src, the tyrosine phosphorylation of Raf-1, and the stimulation
	of Raf-1 kinase activity. These results suggest that Raf-1 may form

	whereas knocking it down is inhibitory. It is a type II membrane
	protein with an extracellular C-terminal enzymatic domain with NADase/NADPase
	and ADPR cyclase activity and a short cytoplasmic N-terminal tail.
	Here we determined whether CD38 enzymatic activity or the cytoplasmic

	CD38 ectoenzyme inhibitor nor a point mutation that cripples enzymatic
	activity (CD38 E226Q) diminishes ATRA-induced differentiation or

	prevents membrane expression and inhibits differentiation and G1/0
	arrest. These results may be consistent with disrupting the function
	of critical molecules necessary for membrane-expressed CD38 signal
	transduction. One candidate molecule is the Src family kinase Fgr,
	which failed to undergo ATRA-induced upregulation in CD38 ?11-20

	after ATRA treatment in CD38 ?11-20 expressing cells. Therefore,
	the ability of CD38 to propel ATRA-induced myeloid differentiation
	and G1/0 arrest is unimpaired by loss of its ectoenzyme activity.
	However a cytosolic tail deletion mutation disrupted membrane localization
	and inhibited differentiation. ATRA-induced differentiation thus
	does not require the CD38 ectoenzyme function, but is dependent on

	AR, were cotransfected with an androgen-inducible chloramphenicol
	acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter gene and an AR expression vector.
	The reporter gene (CAT) was driven either by artificial promoters
	consisting of one or two androgen-responsive elements in front of
	a TATA box or by the promoter of the prostate-specific antigen (PSA)
	gene, a naturally occurring androgen-inducible promoter. Insulin-like
	growth factor-I (IGF-I), at a concentration of 50 ng/ml, stimulated
	AR-mediated reporter gene transcription to the same extent as the
	synthetic androgen methyltrienolone. This growth factor was effective
	irrespective of the nature of the androgen-inducible promoter. Keratinocyte
	growth factor (KGF) and epidermal growth factor (EGF), at concentrations
	of 50 ng/ml, activated CAT reporter gene transcription only in experiments
	in which the artificial promoter with two androgen-responsive elements

	factor displayed no effect on AR-mediated gene transcription. None
	of the growth factors stimulated reporter gene activity in control

	growth factors was studied in the LNCaP cell line by determination
	of PSA secretion. IGF-I, at a concentration of 50 ng/ml, increased
	the PSA level in the supernatant of this cell line 5-fold. Again,
	the IGF-I effect on PSA secretion was blocked by casodex. Our results
	provide evidence that IGF-I, KGF, and EGF directly activate the AR

	Abstract = {The Raf-1 protein kinase is a major activator of the ERK MAPK pathway,
	which links signaling by a variety of cell surface receptors to the
	regulation of cell proliferation, survival, differentiation and migration.
	Signaling by Raf-1 is regulated by a complex and poorly understood
	interplay between phosphorylation events and protein-protein interactions.
	One important mode of Raf-1 regulation involves the phosphorylation-dependent
	binding of 14-3-3 proteins. Here, we have examined the mechanism
	whereby the C-terminal 14-3-3 binding site of Raf-1, S621, controls
	the activation of MEK-ERK signaling. We show that phosphorylation
	of S621 turns over rapidly and is enriched in the activated pool
	of endogenous Raf-1. The phosphorylation on this site can be mediated
	by Raf-1 itself but also by other kinase(s). Mutations that prevent
	the binding of 14-3-3 proteins to S621 render Raf-1 inactive by specifically
	disrupting its capacity to bind to ATP, and not by gross conformational

	Abstract = {With the recent pressure to control health care expenditures, the
	costs of patient participation in clinical trials, especially in
	their earliest phases, have come under increasingly intense scrutiny.
	We therefore reviewed our experience in patients with acute promyelocytic
	leukemia (APL) who were treated during the first US trial of a new
	experimental drug, all-trans retinoic acid (RA). The purpose of the
	review was to evaluate parameters of patient morbidity and financial
	cost associated with the use of all-trans RA compared with standard
	chemotherapy for induction of complete remission in newly-diagnosed
	patients with APL. We retrospectively compared outcomes of consecutive
	patients treated during the first 2 years of our studies that used
	all-trans RA for remission induction (1990-1992) with an identical
	number of patients consecutively treated with standard chemotherapy
	(cytosine arabinoside plus an anthracycline) during the immediately
	preceding period (1985-1990). Responding patients in both groups
	received post-remission chemotherapy. Evaluation parameters included
	transfusions of packed red blood cells and platelets, use of anti-bacterial
	and anti-fungal drugs, duration of fever, time to remission, length
	of hospital stay, hospital charges, and both overall and relapse-free
	survival. Thirty patients were evaluated in each group. Complete
	remission was achieved in 26 patients (87\%) treated with all-trans
	RA, and 24 patients (77\%) treated with chemotherapy (p = 0.5). In
	the chemotherapy group, there were five early deaths (four from hemorrhage,
	one from sepsis); one other patient was resistant to treatment and
	died at 6 months. Four patients in the all-trans RA group died prior
	to response from complications of the 'retinoic acid syndrome'. The
	median time to complete response by all criteria was 41 days (range,
	18-78) for the all-trans RA group and 50 days (range, 24-121) for
	patients who received conventional chemotherapy (p = 0.2). Looking
	only at patients who achieved remission, chemotherapy-treated patients
	required a significantly greater number of platelet transfusions
	(medians, 14 vs. 4; p < 0.001) and packed red blood cell transfusions
	(15 vs. 4; p < 0.001). Patients who received chemotherapy also experienced
	a significantly larger number of days with fever (13 vs. 6; p = 0.01)
	that was reflected in a greater median number of days on combination
	antibiotics (35 vs. 21; p = 0.001) and Amphotericin B (20 vs. 0;

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Combined androgen blockade for the treatment of metastatic
	prostate cancer consists of an antiandrogen drug plus castration.
	In a previous trial, we found that adding the antiandrogen flutamide
	to leuprolide acetate (a synthetic gonadotropin-releasing hormone
	that results in medical ablation of testicular function) significantly
	improved survival as compared with that achieved with placebo plus
	leuprolide acetate. In the current trial, we compared flutamide plus
	bilateral orchiectomy with placebo plus orchiectomy. METHODS: We
	randomly assigned patients who had never received antiandrogen therapy
	and who had distant metastases from adenocarcinoma of the prostate
	to treatment with bilateral orchiectomy and either flutamide or placebo.
	Patients were stratified according to the extent of disease and according
	to performance status. RESULTS: Of the 1387 patients who were enrolled
	in the trial, 700 were randomly assigned to the flutamide group and
	687 to the placebo group. Overall, the incidence of toxic effects
	was minimal; the only notable differences between the groups were
	the greater rates of diarrhea and anemia with flutamide. There was
	no significant difference between the two groups in overall survival
	(P=0.14). The estimated risk of death (hazard ratio) for flutamide
	as compared with placebo was 0.91 (90 percent confidence interval,
	0.81 to 1.01). Flutamide was not associated with enhanced benefit
	in patients with minimal disease. CONCLUSIONS: The addition of flutamide
	to bilateral orchiectomy does not result in a clinically meaningful
	improvement in survival among patients with metastatic prostate cancer.},

	(mEGF), human EGF (hEGF), and transforming growth factor alpha (TGF
	alpha) bind to the human EGF receptor (EGFR) with similar affinities
	at pH 7.4. However, the binding properties of these ligands have
	substantially different pH sensitivities resulting in varying degrees

	of endosomes. We employed a steady-state sorting assay to determine
	the fraction of ligand sorted to recycling versus degradation as
	a function of the number of intracellular ligand molecules in mouse
	B82 fibroblasts. mEGF, hEGF, and TGF alpha display significantly
	different steady-state endosomal sorting patterns which correspond
	to the extent of their dissociation at endosomal pH. Moreover, several
	recombinant hEGF mutants with differing affinities exhibit altered
	endosomal sorting compared to hEGF, demonstrating a similar direct

	Abstract = {PURPOSE: To investigate the pharmacokinetics of arsenic species in
	Japanese patients with relapsed or refractory acute promyelocytic
	leukemia (APL) treated with arsenic trioxide (ATO) at a daily dose
	of 0.15 mg/kg. METHODS: Inorganic arsenic (AsIII and AsV) and the
	major metabolites monomethylarsonic acid (MAA(V)) and dimethylarsinic
	acid (DMAA(V)) in plasma and urine collected from 12 Japanese patients
	were quantified by HPLC/ICP-MS. RESULTS: The plasma concentrations
	of AsIII and AsV on day 1 reached the similar Cmax (12.4 +/- 8.4
	and 10.2 +/- 3.9 ng/ml) immediately after completion of administration
	followed by a biphasic elimination. The AUC(0-infinity) of AsV was
	about twice that of AsIII. The appearance of methylated metabolites
	in the blood was delayed. During the repeated administration, the
	plasma concentrations of inorganic arsenic reached the steady state.
	In contrast, the MAA(V) and DMAA(V) concentrations increased in relation
	to increased administration frequency. The mean total arsenic excretion
	rate including inorganic arsenic and methylated arsenic was about
	20\% of daily dose on day 1 and remained at about 60\% of daily dose
	during week 1-4. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that ATO is
	metabolized when administered intravenously to APL patients and methylated
	metabolites are promptly eliminated from the blood and excreted into
	urine after completion of administration, indicating no measurable
	accumulation of ATO in the blood.},

	Abstract = {Advances in molecular biology provide an opportunity to develop detailed
	models of biological processes that can be used to obtain an integrated
	understanding of the system. However, development of useful models
	from the available knowledge of the system and experimental observations
	still remains a daunting task. In this work, a model identification
	strategy for complex biological networks is proposed. The approach
	includes a state regulator problem (SRP) that provides estimates
	of all the component concentrations and the reaction rates of the
	network using the available measurements. The full set of the estimates
	is utilised for model parameter identification for the network of
	known topology. An a priori model complexity test that indicates
	the feasibility of performance of the proposed algorithm is developed.
	Fisher information matrix (FIM) theory is used to address model identifiability
	issues. Two signalling pathway case studies, the caspase function
	in apoptosis and the MAP kinase cascade system, are considered. The
	MAP kinase cascade, with measurements restricted to protein complex
	concentrations, fails the a priori test and the SRP estimates are
	poor as expected. The apoptosis network structure used in this work
	has moderate complexity and is suitable for application of the proposed
	tools. Using a measurement set of seven protein concentrations, accurate
	estimates for all unknowns are obtained. Furthermore, the effects
	of measurement sampling frequency and quality of information in the
	measurement set on the performance of the identified model are described.},

	been investigating the mechanisms underlying androgen-independent

	in culture, they act synergistically in vivo to promote tumorigenicity
	and androgen independence in the context of the prostate microenvironment.
	We propose that androgen independence emerges by means of epithelial-stromal
	competition, in which activation of Akt and Erk promotes AR activity
	in the prostate epithelium while counteracting antagonistic effects

	Abstract = {Androgen receptor (AR) is a member of the steroid hormone receptor
	family of molecules. AR primarily is responsible for mediating the
	physiologic effects of androgens by binding to specific DNA sequences
	that influence transcription of androgen-responsive genes. The three-dimensional
	structure of the AR ligand-binding domain has shown it is similar
	to other steroid hormone receptors and that ligand binding alters
	the protein conformation to allow binding of coactivator molecules
	that amplify the hormone signal and mediate transcriptional initiation.
	However, AR also undergoes intramolecular interactions that regulate
	its interactions with coactivators and influence its activity. A
	large number of naturally occurring mutations of the human AR gene
	have provided important information about AR molecular structure
	and intermolecular interactions. AR is also a critical mediator of
	prostate cancer promotion, conferring growth signals to prostate
	cancer cells throughout the natural history of the disease. Late-stage
	prostate cancer, unresponsive to hormonal deprivation, sustains AR
	signaling through a diverse array of molecular strategies. Variations
	in the AR gene may also confer genetic predisposition to prostate
	cancer development and severity. Further understanding of AR action
	and new strategies to interfere with AR signaling hold promise for

	Abstract = {Oxidative burst, a critical antimicrobial mechanism of neutrophils,
	involves the rapid generation and release of reactive oxygen intermediates
	(ROIs) by the NADPH oxidase complex. Genetic mutations in an NADPH
	oxidase subunit, gp91 (also referred to as NOX2), are associated
	with chronic granulomatous disease (CGD), which is characterized
	by recurrent and life-threatening microbial infections. To combat
	such infections, ROIs are produced by neutrophils after stimulation
	by integrin-dependent adhesion to the ECM in conjunction with stimulation
	from inflammatory mediators, or microbial components containing pathogen-associated
	molecular patterns. In this report, we provide genetic evidence that
	both the Vav family of Rho GTPase guanine nucleotide exchange factors
	(GEFs) and phospholipase C-gamma2 (PLC-gamma2) are critical mediators
	of adhesion-dependent ROI production by neutrophils in mice. We also
	demonstrated that Vav was critically required for neutrophil-dependent
	host defense against systemic infection by Staphylococcus aureus
	and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 2 common pathogens associated with fatal
	cases of hospital-acquired pneumonia. We identified a molecular pathway
	in which Vav GEFs linked integrin-mediated signaling with PLC-gamma2
	activation, release of intracellular Ca2+ cations, and generation
	of diacylglycerol to control assembly of the NADPH oxidase complex
	and ROI production by neutrophils. Taken together, our data indicate
	that integrin-dependent signals generated during neutrophil adhesion
	contribute to the activation of NADPH oxidase by a variety of distinct
	effector pathways, all of which require Vav.},

	Abstract = {Quantitative computational models play an increasingly important role
	in modern biology. Such models typically involve many free parameters,
	and assigning their values is often a substantial obstacle to model
	development. Directly measuring in vivo biochemical parameters is
	difficult, and collectively fitting them to other experimental data
	often yields large parameter uncertainties. Nevertheless, in earlier
	work we showed in a growth-factor-signaling model that collective
	fitting could yield well-constrained predictions, even when it left
	individual parameters very poorly constrained. We also showed that
	the model had a "sloppy" spectrum of parameter sensitivities, with
	eigenvalues roughly evenly distributed over many decades. Here we
	use a collection of models from the literature to test whether such
	sloppy spectra are common in systems biology. Strikingly, we find
	that every model we examine has a sloppy spectrum of sensitivities.
	We also test several consequences of this sloppiness for building
	predictive models. In particular, sloppiness suggests that collective
	fits to even large amounts of ideal time-series data will often leave
	many parameters poorly constrained. Tests over our model collection
	are consistent with this suggestion. This difficulty with collective
	fits may seem to argue for direct parameter measurements, but sloppiness
	also implies that such measurements must be formidably precise and
	complete to usefully constrain many model predictions. We confirm
	this implication in our growth-factor-signaling model. Our results
	suggest that sloppy sensitivity spectra are universal in systems
	biology models. The prevalence of sloppiness highlights the power
	of collective fits and suggests that modelers should focus on predictions
	rather than on parameters.},

	AR expression is maintained throughout prostate cancer progression,
	and the majority of androgen-independent or hormone refractory prostate
	cancers express AR. Mutation of AR, especially mutations that result
	in a relaxation of AR ligand specificity, may contribute to the progression
	of prostate cancer and the failure of endocrine therapy by allowing
	AR transcriptional activation in response to antiandrogens or other
	endogenous hormones. Similarly, alterations in the relative expression
	of AR coregulators have been found to occur with prostate cancer
	progression and may contribute to differences in AR ligand specificity
	or transcriptional activity. Prostate cancer progression is also
	associated with increased growth factor production and an altered
	response to growth factors by prostate cancer cells. The kinase signal
	transduction cascades initiated by mitogenic growth factors modulate
	the transcriptional activity of AR and the interaction between AR
	and AR coactivators. The inhibition of AR activity through mechanisms

	of serines 259 and 621 in C-Raf and serines 364 and 728 in B-Raf
	has been suggested to be critical for association with 14-3-3 proteins.
	To study the functional consequences of Raf phosphorylations at these
	positions, we developed and characterized phosphospecific antibodies
	directed against 14-3-3 binding epitopes: a monoclonal phosphospecific
	antibody (6B4) directed against pS621 and a polyclonal antibody specific
	for B-Raf-pS364 epitope. Although 6B4 detected both C- and B-Raf
	in Western blots, it specifically recognizes the native form of C-Raf
	but not B-Raf. Contrary to B-Raf, a kinase-dead mutant of C-Raf was
	found to be only poorly phosphorylated in the Ser-621 position. Moreover,
	serine 259 to alanine mutation prevented the Ser-621 phosphorylation
	suggesting an interdependence between these two 14-3-3 binding domains.
	Direct C-Raf.14-3-3 binding studies with purified proteins combined
	with competition assays revealed that the 14-3-3 binding domain surrounding
	pS621 represents the high affinity binding site, whereas the pS259
	epitope mediates lower affinity binding. Raf isozymes differ in their
	14-3-3 association rates. The time course of endogenous C-Raf activation
	in mammalian cells by nerve growth factor (NGF) has been examined
	using both phosphospecific antibodies directed against 14-3-3 binding
	sites (6B4 and anti-pS259) as well as phosphospecific antibodies
	directed against the activation domain (anti-pS338 and anti-pY340/pY341).
	Time course of Ser-621 phosphorylation, in contrast to Ser-259 phosphorylation,
	exhibited unexpected pattern reaching maximal phosphorylation within
	30 s of NGF stimulation. Phosphorylation of tyrosine 340/341 reached
	maximal levels subsequent to Ser-621 phosphorylation and was coincident
	with emergence of kinase activity. Taken together, we found substantial
	differences between C-Raf.14-3-3 binding epitopes pS259 and pS621

@article{Hong2001,
	Abstract = {Retinoic acid (RA) is known to cause the myeloid differentiation of
	HL-60 human myeloblastic leukemia cells in a process requiring MEK-dependent
	ERK2 activation. This RA-induced ERK2 activation appears after approximately
	4 h and persists until the cells are differentiated and G0 arrested
	(Yen et al, 1998). This motivates the question of whether RA also
	activated RAF as part of a typical RAF/MEK/MAPK cascade. Retinoic
	acid is shown here to also increase the phosphorylation of RAF, but
	in an unusual way. Surprisingly, increased RAF phosphorylation is
	first detectable after 12 to 24 hours by phosphorylation-induced
	retardation of polyacrylamide gel electrophoretic mobility. The RA-induced
	increased RAF phosphorylation is still apparent after 72 hours of
	treatment when most cells are differentiated and G0 arrested. There
	is a progressive dose-response relationship with 10(-8), 10(-7),
	and 10(-6) M RA. The RA-induced RAF phosphorylation corresponds to
	increased in vitro kinase activity. Inhibition of MEK with a PD98059
	dose which inhibits ERK2 phosphorylation and subsequent cell differentiation
	also inhibits RAF phosphorylation. RA-induced MEK-dependent RAF phosphorylation
	is not due to changes in the amount of cellular MEK. The induced
	RAF phosphorylation, as well as anteceding ERK2 activation, depends
	on ligand-induced activation of both an RARalpha receptor and an
	RXR receptor. This and the slow kinetics of activation suggest a
	need for prior RA-induced gene expression. In summary, RA induces
	a MEK-dependent prolonged RAF activation, whose slow onset occurs
	after ERK2 activation but still well before cell cycle arrest and
	cell differentiation. The RA-induced increased RAF phosphorylation
	thus differs from typical mitogenic growth factor signaling, features
	that may contribute to cell cycle arrest and differentiation instead
	of division as the cellular outcome.},

	Abstract = {Androgen receptor (AR)-associated coregulator 70 (ARA70) was the first
	identified AR coregulator. However, its molecular mechanism and biological
	relevance to prostate cancer remain unclear. Here we show that ARA70
	interacts with and promotes AR activity via the consensus FXXLF motif
	within the ARA70-N2 domain (amino acids 176-401). However, it does
	not promote AR activity via the classic LXXLL motif located at amino
	acids 92-96, although this classic LXXLL motif is important for ARA70
	to interact with other receptors, such as PPARgamma. The molecular
	mechanisms by which ARA70 enhances AR transactivation involve the
	increase of AR expression, protein stability, and nuclear translocation.
	Furthermore, ARA70 protein is more frequently detected in prostate
	cancer specimens (91.74%) than in benign tissues (64.64%, p < 0.0001).
	ARA70 expression is also increased in high-grade prostate cancer
	tissues as well as the hormone-refractory LNCaP xenografts and prostate
	cancer cell lines. Because ARA70 can promote the antiandrogen hydroxyflutamide
	(HF)-enhanced AR transactivation, the increased ARA70 expression
	in hormone-refractory prostate tumors may confer the development
	of HF withdrawal syndrome, commonly diagnosed in patients with the
	later stages of prostate cancer. Because ARA70-N2 containing the
	AR-interacting FXXLF motif without coactivation function can suppress
	HF-enhanced AR transactivation in the hormone-refractory LNCaP cells,
	using the ARA70-N2 inhibitory peptide at the hormone refractory stage

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: The acquisition of an androgen-independent phenotype is
	the most serious issue of prostate cancer treatment. Although several
	experimental cell models have been reported for studying androgen
	independence, they have limited applications related to hormone-refractory
	prostate cancer. To investigate the molecular mechanism of androgen-independent
	growth of prostate cancer, we established a useful LNCaP cell model
	that resembles the clinical scenario of hormone-refractory prostate
	cancer. METHODS: Androgen-sensitive LNCaP parental cells were continuously
	maintained in a regular cell-culture medium, that is, phenol red-positive
	RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 5\% fetal bovine serum and 1\%
	glutamine. Upon passage, the androgen responsiveness of those cells
	decreased, to a level lower than that of parental cells. We examined
	the growth properties and androgen responsiveness of these different
	LNCaP cells in vitro and in vivo. Cytogenetic characteristics and
	expression of androgen receptors (ARs) and prostate-specific antigen
	(PSA) were determined. RESULTS: Upon continuous passage, the biological
	behavior of parental C-33 cells (passage number less than 33) was
	altered. C-81 cells (passage number higher than 81) clearly exhibited
	more aggressive growth and lower androgen responsiveness than C-33
	and C-51 cells (passage number between 35 and 80) in vitro and in
	vivo. Nevertheless, all these cells expressed a similar level of
	functional AR protein as well as a similar genetic profile. Moreover,
	in a steroid-reduced culture condition, C-81 cells secreted a higher
	level of PSA than C-33 cells. CONCLUSIONS: Our LNCaP cell model closely
	recapitulates the progression of human prostate cancer from the androgen-responsive
	to the hormone-refractory state under the androgen nondeprived condition.
	This cell model may provide the opportunity to understand the molecular
	mechanisms associated with the acquisition of androgen independence

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although the molecular mechanism of androgen-independent
	prostate cancer growth and progression has been gradually elucidated,
	there is limited effective treatment for this prevalent disease.
	Human prostatic acid phosphatase (PAcP), a major protein tyrosine
	phosphatase in prostate epithelium, plays a critical role in regulating
	the growth of prostate cancer cells. In prostate carcinomas, the
	expression of cellular PAcP decreases. To explore directly the possible
	therapeutic potential of cellular PAcP, we investigated the suppression
	effect of PAcP by utilizing cDNA direct intratumoral administration
	in androgen-independent LNCaP xenograft tumors. METHODS: An androgen-independent
	LNCaP cell model (C-33 and C-81 cells) and stable subclones of PAcP
	cDNA-transfected C-81 cells (LNCaP-23 and LNCaP-34 cells) were used
	for the experiments. We examined the growth property and expression
	of PAcP and c-ErbB-2 of these different LNCaP cells in vitro and
	in vivo. We subsequently investigated the growth suppression effect
	of PAcP cDNA intratumoral injection in pre-established C-81 xenograft
	tumors, and analyzed the expression of PAcP, prostate-specific antigen
	(PSA), proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), and c-ErbB-2 in
	the tumors by immunohistochemistry and Western blotting. RESULTS:
	The different LNCaP cells exhibited different growth property and
	tumorigenicity, both in cell culture and xenograft. Biochemical characterizations
	revealed that the level of cellular PAcP correlated negatively with
	the growth property of different LNCaP cells, while the level of
	tyrophosphorylated c-ErbB-2 had an inverse correlation with cellular
	PAcP. The single intratumoral administration of the wild type PAcP
	cDNA showed a significant suppression effect on C-81 xenograft tumor
	growth, compared to vector alone-injected control (P<0.05). In the
	tumors injected with this PAcP cDNA, the PAcP expression was detected
	1 week (wk) after injection, but was undetectable at 6 wk, which
	inversely correlated with the level of tyrophosphorylated c-ErbB-2
	and the degree of cell proliferation indicated by PCNA staining.
	CONCLUSIONS: Our results clearly demonstrated that cellular PAcP
	has a suppression effect on the growth of androgen-independent LNCaP
	xenograft tumors. This effect occurs at least partly through the
	dephosphorylation of c-ErbB-2 by PAcP, the prostate-specific protein
	tyrosine phosphatase. The data indicates that human PAcP could be
	utilized in the corrective gene therapy for a subgroup of androgen-independent
	human prostate cancer cells that lack cellular PAcP expression.},

	Abstract = {Each year, the American Cancer Society (ACS) estimates the number
	of new cancer cases and deaths expected in the United States in the
	current year and compiles the most recent data on cancer incidence,
	mortality, and survival based on incidence data from the National
	Cancer Institute, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and
	the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries and mortality
	data from the National Center for Health Statistics. This report
	considers incidence data through 2003 and mortality data through
	2004. Incidence and death rates are age-standardized to the 2000
	US standard million population. A total of 1,444,920 new cancer cases
	and 559,650 deaths for cancers are projected to occur in the United
	States in 2007. Notable trends in cancer incidence and mortality
	rates include stabilization of the age-standardized, delay-adjusted
	incidence rates for all cancers combined in men from 1995 through
	2003; a continuing increase in the incidence rate by 0.3\% per year
	in women; and a 13.6\% total decrease in age-standardized cancer
	death rates among men and women combined between 1991 and 2004. This
	report also examines cancer incidence, mortality, and survival by
	site, sex, race/ethnicity, geographic area, and calendar year, as
	well as the proportionate contribution of selected sites to the overall
	trends. While the absolute number of cancer deaths decreased for
	the second consecutive year in the United States (by more than 3,000
	from 2003 to 2004) and much progress has been made in reducing mortality
	rates and improving survival, cancer still accounts for more deaths
	than heart disease in persons under age 85 years. Further progress
	can be accelerated by supporting new discoveries and by applying
	existing cancer control knowledge across all segments of the population.},

	multiple signaling pathways and rapid endocytosis of the epidermal

	Shc, H-Ras, and K-Ras with enhanced cyan fluorescent protein (CFP)
	or yellow fluorescent protein (YFP), and used live-cell fluorescence
	imaging microscopy combined with the fluorescence resonance energy

	the accumulation of large pools of Grb2-CFP and YFP-Shc in endosomes,
	where these two adaptor proteins formed a complex with EGFR. H-Ras
	and K-Ras fusion proteins were found at the plasma membrane, particularly
	in ruffles and lamellipodia, and also in endosomes independently
	of GTP/GDP loading and EGF stimulation. The relative amount of endosomal
	H-Ras was higher than that of K-Ras, whereas K-Ras predominated at
	the plasma membrane. On application of EGF, Grb2, and Ras converge
	in the same endosomes through the fusion of endosomes containing
	either Grb2 or Ras or through the joint internalization of two proteins
	from the plasma membrane. To examine the localization of the GTP-bound
	form of Ras, we used a FRET assay that exploits the specific interaction
	of GTP-bound CFP-Ras with the YFP-fused Ras binding domain of c-Raf.
	FRET microscopy revealed that GTP-bound Ras is located at the plasma

	Abstract = {In this study, it was shown that the proportion of guanosine triphosphate
	(GTP)-bound active Ras increased in TPA (12-o-tetradecanoyl phorbol-13-acetate)-induced
	monocytic differentiation of HL-60 cells. The increase of active
	Ras was observed at 24 hours after TPA stimulation and attained to
	threefold (15\%) over the proportion in nontreated HL-60 cells. Herbimycin
	A, an inhibitor of tyrosine kinase, prevented the activation of Ras,
	as well as the induction of monocytic differentiation. In parallel
	with the activation of Ras, the proteins with molecular weights of
	52, 56, 62, and 190 kD were tyrosine-phosphorylated and formed a
	complex with GTPase-activating protein (GAP) for Ras. In addition
	to the 116-kD GAP (type I GAP), the 100-kD GAP (type II GAP) molecule
	was markedly induced at 24 hours after TPA stimulation of HL-60 cells.
	These phenomena sustained for a further 24 hours during monocytic
	differentiation. However, they were not observed during retinoic
	acid-induced granulocytic differentiation of the cells. The HL-60
	transfectants, which expressed a dominant inhibitory Ha-ras Asn17,
	showed a low level of tyrosine-phosphorylated GAP-associated proteins
	and did not undergo full differentiation in response to TPA. Taken
	together, these data indicate that the activation of Ras and GAP
	complex formation mutually correlate and function downstream of protein-tyrosine

	Abstract = {During the past decade, our knowledge of molecular mechanisms involved
	in growth factor signaling has proliferated almost explosively. However,
	the kinetics and control of information transfer through signaling
	networks remain poorly understood. This paper combines experimental
	kinetic analysis and computational modeling of the short term pattern
	of cellular responses to epidermal growth factor (EGF) in isolated
	hepatocytes. The experimental data show transient tyrosine phosphorylation
	of the EGF receptor (EGFR) and transient or sustained response patterns
	in multiple signaling proteins targeted by EGFR. Transient responses
	exhibit pronounced maxima, reached within 15-30 s of EGF stimulation
	and followed by a decline to relatively low (quasi-steady-state)
	levels. In contrast to earlier suggestions, we demonstrate that the
	experimentally observed transients can be accounted for without requiring
	receptor-mediated activation of specific tyrosine phosphatases, following
	EGF stimulation. The kinetic model predicts how the cellular response
	is controlled by the relative levels and activity states of signaling
	proteins and under what conditions activation patterns are transient
	or sustained. EGFR signaling patterns appear to be robust with respect
	to variations in many elemental rate constants within the range of
	experimentally measured values. On the other hand, we specify which
	changes in the kinetic scheme, rate constants, and total amounts
	of molecular factors involved are incompatible with the experimentally
	observed kinetics of signal transfer. Quantitation of signaling network
	responses to growth factors allows us to assess how cells process
	information controlling their growth and differentiation.},

	occur in the p53 null condition. We report herein that senescence-associated
	phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases 1 and
	2 (SA-pErk1/2) enhanced p21(Sdi1) transcription by phosphorylating
	Sp1 on Ser(59) downstream of protein kinase C (PKC) alpha. Reactive
	oxygen species (ROS), which was increased in cellular senescence,
	significantly activated both PKCalpha and PKCbetaI. However, PKCalpha,
	but not PKCbetaI, regulated ROS generation and cell proliferation
	in senescent cells along with activation of cdk2, proven by siRNAs.
	PKCalpha-siRNA also reduced SA-pErk1/2 expression in old human diploid
	fibroblast cells, accompanied with changes of senescence phenotypes
	to young cell-like. Regulation of SA-pErk1/2 was also confirmed by
	using catalytically active PKCalpha and its DN-mutant construct.
	These findings strongly suggest a new pathway to regulate senescence
	phenotypes by ROS via Sp1 phosphorylation between PKCalpha and SA-pErk1/2:
	employing GST-Sp1 mutants and MEK inhibitor analyses, we found that
	SA-pErk1/2 regulated Sp1 phosphorylation on the Ser(59) residue in
	vivo, but not threonine, in cellular senescence, which regulated
	transcription of p21(Sdi1) expression. In summary, PKCalpha, which
	was activated in senescent cells by ROS strongly activated Erk1/2,
	and the SA-pErk1/2 in turn phosphorylated Sp1 on Ser(59). Sp1-enhanced
	transcription of p21(Sdi1) resulted in regulation of cellular senescence

	Abstract = {Prostate specific antigen (PSA) is a serine protease that is synthesized
	by both normal and malignant epithelial cells of the human prostate.
	PSA expressed by malignant cells, however, are released into the
	serum at an increased level, which can be detected to diagnose and
	monitor prostate cancer. Moreover, increases in serum PSA following
	local and systemic treatments are highly correlated with tumor recurrence
	and progression, and this association has further established PSA
	as a clinically important biomarker. The expression of PSA is mainly
	induced by androgens and regulated by the androgen receptor (AR)
	at the transcriptional level. Extensive research on the regulation
	of PSA gene expression has provided significant information about
	the function of AR, which is a crucial transcription factor involved
	in all phases of prostate cancer. Still, the molecular mechanism(s)
	by which the transcription of the PSA gene escapes regulation in
	advanced prostate cancer has yet to be clearly defined. Accumulating
	evidence suggests that a number of processes including androgen-independent
	activation of AR are involved. Lacking an effective treatment, advanced
	prostate cancer is almost invariably fatal, which highlights the
	importance of elucidating mechanisms of tumor progression. Insights
	into AR activity at the PSA gene could be extended to transcriptional
	regulation of other AR target genes, which may be crucial in discerning
	prostate cancer progression. Ultimately, our improved understanding
	of AR-regulated PSA expression could aid in developing viable therapies
	in treating and/or preventing advanced prostate cancer.},

	tumor growth. Models to study these progressive changes are lacking.
	Here we describe the propagation of advanced human prostate cancer
	by direct transfer of surgical samples from patients into immune-deficient
	male SCID mice. Explants from six of eight patients formed prostate
	tumors and two showed unique cytogenetic, biologic and molecular
	features that were retained through six or more passages. One grew
	in an androgen-independent fashion, whereas the second formed tumors
	that regressed following castration then regrew. Micrometastatic
	disease was detected in the hematopoietic tissues of half of the

	Inhibition of Ser-259 dephosphorylation has no effect on the activation

	Abstract = {The expression and secretion of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) are
	regulated by androgens in normal prostate secretory epithelial cells.
	In prostate cancer patients, the serum PSA level is usually elevated
	and cancer cells are initially responsive to androgens. However,
	those cancer cells become androgen-independent after androgen ablation
	therapy. In hormone-refractory cancer patients, even in an androgen-deprived
	environment, the circulation level of PSA rebounds and is constitutively
	elevated through a yet unknown mechanism. Tyrosine phosphorylation
	of ErbB-2 is involved in regulating the androgen-responsive phenotype
	of prostate cancer cells, and it is at least partly regulated by
	the cellular form of prostatic acid phosphatase (PAcP), a prostate-unique
	protein tyrosine phosphatase. We investigated the ErbB-2 signal pathway
	in androgen-independent PSA secretion. LNCaP C-81 cells, which are
	androgen-independent LNCaP cells lacking endogenous PAcP expression
	with a hypertyrosine phosphorylated ErbB-2, secreted a higher level
	of PSA in conditioned media than did androgen-sensitive LNCaP C-33
	parental cells. A restored expression of cellular PAcP in C-81 cells
	was concurrent with a decrease in tyrophosphorylation of ErbB-2 and
	reduction of PSA secretion. Moreover, transient transfection of C-33
	cells with the wild-type ErbB-2 or a constitutively active mutant
	of MEK1 cDNA resulted in an increased level of secreted PSA. The
	elevation of secreted PSA level by the forced expression of ErbB-2
	was inhibited by an MEK inhibitor, PD98059. In C-81 cells, the expression
	of a dominant negative mutant of ErbB-2 reduced the secreted level
	of PSA. The inhibition of ErbB-2 or mitogen-activated protein (MAP)
	kinases by specific inhibitors AG879, AG825, or PD98059 led to a
	decrease in PSA secretion. Taken together, our data clearly indicate
	that the ErbB-2 signal pathway via MAP kinases (ERK1/2) is involved
	in regulating the secretion of PSA by androgen-independent human
	prostate cancer LNCaP C-81 cells in an androgen-depleted environment.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Mathematic models and sensitivity analyses of biologic
	pathways have been used for exploring the dynamics and for detecting
	the key components of signaling pathways. METHODS: The authors previously
	developed a mathematic model of the epidermal growth factor receptor-extracellular
	signal-regulated protein kinase (EGFR-ERK) pathway using ordinary
	differential equations from existing EGFR-ERK pathway models. By
	using prolonged ERK activation as an indicator that may lead to cell
	proliferation under certain circumstances, in the current study,
	a pathway sensitivity analysis was performed to test its capability
	of detecting pro-proliferative activities through altered protein
	levels to examine the effects on ERK activation. RESULTS: The analysis
	revealed that 12 of 20 oncoproteins and 4 of 5 tumor suppressors
	were detected, consistent with reported experimental works. Because
	pathway dynamics depend on many factors, some of which were not included
	in the current models, failure to detect all known oncogenes and
	tumor suppressors can be because of the failure to include relevant
	crosstalk to other pathway components. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the
	current results indicated that pathway sensitivity analysis is a
	useful approach for detecting and distinguishing pro-proliferation
	activities of oncoproteins and suppressed proliferative activities
	of tumor suppressors at altered protein levels at least in the EGFR-ERK
	model.},

	Abstract = {Mammalian glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) is a homohexameric enzyme
	that catalyzes the reversible oxidative deamination of l-glutamate
	to 2-oxoglutarate using NAD(P)(+) as coenzyme. Unlike its counterparts
	from other animal kingdoms, mammalian GDH is regulated by a host
	of ligands. The recently discovered hyperinsulinism/hyperammonemia
	disorder showed that the loss of allosteric inhibition of GDH by
	GTP causes excessive secretion of insulin. Subsequent studies demonstrated
	that wild-type and hyperinsulinemia/hyperammonemia forms of GDH are
	inhibited by the green tea polyphenols, epigallocatechin gallate
	and epicatechin gallate. This was followed by high throughput studies
	that identified more stable inhibitors, including hexachlorophene,
	GW5074, and bithionol. Shown here are the structures of GDH complexed
	with these three compounds. Hexachlorophene forms a ring around the
	internal cavity in GDH through aromatic stacking interactions between
	the drug and GDH as well as between the drug molecules themselves.
	In contrast, GW5074 and bithionol both bind as pairs of stacked compounds
	at hexameric 2-fold axes between the dimers of subunits. The internal
	core of GDH contracts when the catalytic cleft closes during enzymatic
	turnover. None of the drugs cause conformational changes in the contact
	residues, but all bind to key interfaces involved in this contraction
	process. Therefore, it seems likely that the drugs inhibit enzymatic
	turnover by inhibiting this transition. Indeed, this expansion/contraction
	process may play a major role in the inter-subunit communication
	and allosteric regulation observed in GDH.},

	Abstract = {Androgen plays a critical role in regulating the growth and differentiation
	of normal prostate epithelia, as well as the initial growth of prostate
	cancer cells. Nevertheless, prostate carcinomas eventually become
	androgen-unresponsive, and the cancer is refractory to hormonal therapy.
	To gain insight into the mechanism involved in this hormone-refractory
	phenomenon, we have examined the potential role of the androgen receptor
	(AR) in that process. We have investigated the expression of AR and
	two prostate-specific androgen-responsive antigens, prostatic acid
	phosphatase (PAcP) and prostate-specific antigen (PSA), for the functional
	activity of AR in LNCaP and PC-3 human prostate carcinoma cells.
	Our results are as follows. (i) Clone 33 LNCaP cells express AR,
	PAcP, and PSA, and cell growth is stimulated by 5alpha-dihydrotestosterone
	(DHT). Stimulation of cell growth correlates with decreased cellular
	PAcP activity. (ii) In clone 81 LNCaP cells, the expression of PAcP
	decreases with a concurrent decrease in the degree of androgen stimulation
	of cell growth, whereas the expression of PSA mRNA level is up-regulated
	by DHT, as in clone 33 cells. Conversely, in PAcP cDNA-transfected
	clone 81 cells, an additional expression of cellular PAcP correlates
	with an increased stimulation by androgen, higher than the corresponding
	control cells. (iii) PC-3 cells express a low level of functional
	AR with no detectable PAcP or PSA, and the growth of PC-3 cells is
	not affected by DHT treatment. Nevertheless, in two PAcP cDNA-transfected
	PC-3 sublines, the expression of exogenous cellular PAcP correlates
	with androgen stimulation. This androgen stimulation of cell growth
	concurs with an increased tyrosine phosphorylation of a phosphoprotein
	of 185 kDa. In summary, the data indicate that the expression of
	AR alone is not sufficient for androgen stimulation of cell growth.
	Furthermore, in AR-expressing prostate cancer cells, the expression
	of cellular PAcP correlates with androgen stimulation of cell proliferation.},

	Abstract = {The role that mechanistic mathematical modeling and systems biology
	will play in molecular medicine and clinical development remains
	uncertain. In this study, mathematical modeling and sensitivity analysis
	were used to explore the working hypothesis that mechanistic models
	of human cascades, despite model uncertainty, can be computationally
	screened for points of fragility, and that these sensitive mechanisms
	could serve as therapeutic targets. We tested our working hypothesis
	by screening a model of the well-studied coagulation cascade, developed
	and validated from literature. The predicted sensitive mechanisms
	were then compared with the treatment literature. The model, composed
	of 92 proteins and 148 protein-protein interactions, was validated
	using 21 published datasets generated from two different quiescent
	in vitro coagulation models. Simulated platelet activation and thrombin
	generation profiles in the presence and absence of natural anticoagulants
	were consistent with measured values, with a mean correlation of
	0.87 across all trials. Overall state sensitivity coefficients, which
	measure the robustness or fragility of a given mechanism, were calculated
	using a Monte Carlo strategy. In the absence of anticoagulants, fluid
	and surface phase factor X/activated factor X (fX/FXa) activity and
	thrombin-mediated platelet activation were found to be fragile, while
	fIX/FIXa and fVIII/FVIIIa activation and activity were robust. Both
	anti-fX/FXa and direct thrombin inhibitors are important classes
	of anticoagulants; for example, anti-fX/FXa inhibitors have FDA approval
	for the prevention of venous thromboembolism following surgical intervention
	and as an initial treatment for deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary
	embolism. Both in vitro and in vivo experimental evidence is reviewed
	supporting the prediction that fIX/FIXa activity is robust. When
	taken together, these results support our working hypothesis that
	computationally derived points of fragility of human relevant cascades
	could be used as a rational basis for target selection despite model
	uncertainty.},

	Abstract = {The commitment of mammalian cells in late G1 to replicate the genome
	and divide in response to mitogenic growth factors operating via
	tyrosine kinase receptors depends on phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma
	protein (pRb), a process controlled by cyclin D-associated cyclin-dependent
	kinases (cdks) and their inhibitors. This study addressed the issue
	of whether also other mitogenic signalling cascades require activation
	of cyclin D-associated kinases or whether any mitogenic pathway can
	bypass the cyclin D-pRb checkpoint. We show that mitogenic signal
	transduction pathways from three classes of receptors, the membrane
	tyrosine kinase receptors activated by serum mitogens or epidermal
	growth factor, estrogen receptors triggered by estradiol, and the
	cyclic AMP-dependent signalling from G-protein-coupled thyrotropin
	receptors, all converge and strictly require the cyclin D-cdk activity
	to induce S phase in human MCF-7 cells and/or primary dog thyrocytes.
	Combined microinjection and biochemical approaches showed that whereas
	these three mitogenic cascades are sensitive to the p16 inhibitor
	of cdk4/6 and/or cyclin D1-neutralizing antibody and able to induce
	pRb kinase activity, their upstream biochemical routes are distinct
	as demonstrated by their differential sensitivity to lovastatin and
	requirements for mitogen-activated protein kinases whose sustained
	activation is seen only in the growth factor-dependent pathway. Taken
	together, these results support the candidacy of the cyclin D-cdk-pRb
	interplay for the convergence step of multiple signalling cascades

	Abstract = {An understanding of the differences and similarities of the retinoid
	X receptor (RXR) and retinoic acid receptor (RAR) systems requires
	knowledge of the diversity of their family members, their patterns
	of expression, and their pharmacological response to ligands. In
	this paper we report the isolation of a family of mouse RXR genes
	encoding three distinct receptors (RXR alpha, beta, and gamma). They
	are closely related to each other in their DNA- and ligand-binding
	domains but are quite divergent from the RAR subfamily in both structure
	and ligand specificity. Recently, we demonstrated that all-trans
	retinoic acid (RA) serves as a "pro-hormone" to the isomer 9-cis
	RA, which is a high-affinity ligand for the human RXR alpha. We extend
	those findings to show that 9-cis RA is also "retinoid X" for mouse
	RXR alpha, beta, and gamma. Trans-activation analyses show that although
	all three RXRs respond to a variety of endogenous retinoids, 9-cis
	RA is their most potent ligand and is up to 40-fold more active than
	all-trans RA. Northern blot and in situ hybridization analyses define
	a broad spectrum of expression for the RXRs, which display unique
	patterns and only partially overlap themselves and the RARs. This
	study suggests that the RXR family plays critical roles in diverse
	aspects of development, from embryo implantation to organogenesis
	and central nervous system differentiation, as well as in adult physiology.},

	are catalyzed by the same phosphatase, can also exhibit bistability

@article{Meng2000,
	Abstract = {Steroid hormones play key roles in regulating cell proliferation and
	differentiation in targeting tissues. However, in advanced cancers,
	the steroid hormone regulation is frequently attenuated through a
	yet unknown mechanism even in the presence of functional steroid
	hormone receptors. We investigate the functional role of tyrosine
	phosphorylation signaling in the hormone-refractory growth of human
	prostate tumors. Initial studies demonstrate that the androgen-responsive
	phenotype of human prostate cancer cells associates with a low phosphotyrosine
	(p-Tyr) level of ErbB-2, which is regulated by cellular prostatic
	acid phosphatase (PAcP), a protein tyrosine phosphatase. In prostate
	cancer cells, the p-Tyr level, but not the protein level, of ErbB-2
	inversely correlates with the androgen-responsiveness of cell proliferation.
	Androgen-stimulated cell growth concurs with a down-regulation of
	cellular PAcP, an elevated p-Tyr level of ErbB-2, and the activation
	of mitogen-activated protein kinases. Furthermore, only the ErbB-2
	inhibitor AG 879, but not the EGFR inhibitor AG 1478, abolishes androgen-induced
	cell proliferation. Forced expression of ErbB-2 can also attenuate
	androgen promotion of cell growth. Data taken collectively conclude
	that in human prostate cancer cells, the tyrosine phosphorylation
	of ErbB-2 regulated by cellular PAcP plays a key role in regulating
	androgen-mediated proliferation signaling. Oncogene (2000).},

@article{Meng1998,
	Abstract = {Human prostatic acid phosphatase (PAcP) is a prostate epithelium-specific
	differentiation antigen. In prostate carcinomas, the cellular PAcP
	is decreased. We investigated its functional role in these cells.
	Several lines of evidence support the hypothesis that cellular PAcP
	functions as a neutral protein-tyrosine phosphatase and is involved
	in regulating prostate cell growth. In this study, we identify its
	in vivo substrate. Our results demonstrated that, in different human
	prostate cancer cell lines, the phosphotyrosine (Tyr(P)) level of
	a 185-kDa phosphoprotein (pp185) inversely correlates with the cellular
	activity of PAcP. On SDS-PAGE, this pp185 co-migrates with the c-ErbB-2
	oncoprotein. Immunodepletion experiments revealed that c-ErbB-2 protein
	is the major pp185 in cells. Results from subclones of LNCaP cells
	indicated the lower the cellular PAcP activity, the higher the Tyr(P)
	levels of c-ErbB-2. This inverse correlation was further observed
	in PAcP cDNA-transfected cells. In clone 33 LNCaP cells, L-(+)-tartrate
	suppresses the cellular PAcP activity and causes an elevated Tyr(P)
	level of c-ErbB-2 protein. Epidermal growth factor stimulates the
	proliferation of LNCaP cells, which concurs with a decreased cellular
	PAcP activity as well as an increased Tyr(P) level of c-ErbB-2. Biochemically,
	PAcP dephosphorylates c-ErbB-2 at pH 7.0. The results thus suggest
	that cellular PAcP down-regulates prostate cell growth by dephosphorylating
	Tyr(P) on c-ErbB-2 oncoprotein in those cells.},

	Abstract = {The production of mature, differentiated myeloid cells is regulated
	by the action of hematopoietic cytokines on progenitor cells in the
	bone marrow. Cytokines drive the process of myeloid differentiation
	by binding to specific cell-surface receptors in a stage- and lineage-specific
	manner. Following the binding of a cytokine to its cognate receptor,
	intracellular signal-transduction pathways become activated that
	facilitate the myeloid differentiation process. These intracellular
	signaling pathways may promote myelopoiesis by stimulating expansion
	of a progenitor pool, supporting cellular survival during the differentiation
	process, or by directly driving the phenotypic changes associated
	with differentiation. Ultimately, pathways that drive the differentiation
	process converge on myeloid transcription factors, including PU.1
	and the C/EBP family, that are critical for differentiation to proceed.
	While much is known about the cytokines, cytokine receptors and transcription
	factors that regulate myeloid differentiation, less is known about
	the precise roles that specific signaling mediators play in promoting
	myeloid differentiation. Recently, however, the application of novel
	pharmacologic inhibitors, siRNA strategies, and transgenic and knockout
	models has begun to shed light on the involvement and function of
	signaling pathways in normal myeloid differentiation. This review
	will discuss the roles that key signaling pathways and mediators
	play in myeloid differentiation.},

	Abstract = {The elevation of cyclic AMP (cAMP) levels in the cell downregulates
	the activity of the Raf-1 kinase. It has been suggested that this
	effect is due to the activation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase
	(PKA), which can directly phosphorylate Raf-1 in vitro. In this study,
	we confirmed this hypothesis by coexpressing Raf-1 with the constitutively
	active catalytic subunit of PKA, which could fully reproduce the
	inhibition previously achieved by cAMP. PKA-phosphorylated Raf-1
	exhibits a reduced affinity for GTP-loaded Ras as well as impaired
	catalytic activity. As the binding to GTP-loaded Ras induces Raf-1
	activation in the cell, we examined which mechanism is required for
	PKA-mediated Raf-1 inhibition in vivo. A Raf-1 point mutant (RafR89L),
	which is unable to bind Ras, as well as the isolated Raf-1 kinase
	domain were still fully susceptible to inhibition by PKA, demonstrating
	that the phosphorylation of the Raf-1 kinase suffices for inhibition.
	By the use of mass spectroscopy and point mutants, PKA phosphorylation
	site was mapped to a single site in the Raf-1 kinase domain, serine
	621. Replacement of serine 621 by alanine or cysteine or destruction
	of the PKA consensus motif by changing arginine 618 resulted in the
	loss of catalytic activity. Notably, a mutation of serine 619 to
	alanine did not significantly affect kinase activity or regulation
	by activators or PKA. Changing serine 621 to aspartic acid yielded
	a Raf-1 protein which, when expressed to high levels in Sf-9 insect
	cells, retained a very low inducible kinase activity that was resistant
	to PKA downregulation. The purified Raf-1 kinase domain displayed
	slow autophosphorylation of serine 621, which correlated with a decrease
	in catalytic function. The Raf-1 kinase domain activated by tyrosine
	phosphorylation could be downregulated by PKA. Specific removal of
	the phosphate residue at serine 621 reactivated the catalytic activity.
	These results are most consistent with a dual role of serine 621.
	On the one hand, serine 621 appears essential for catalytic activity;
	on the other hand, it serves as a phosphorylation site which confers
	negative regulation.},

	Abstract = {The duration of intracellular signalling is associated with distinct
	biological responses, but how cells interpret differences in signal
	duration are unknown. We show that the immediate early gene product
	c-Fos functions as a sensor for ERK1 (extracellular-signal-regulated
	kinase 1) and ERK2 signal duration. When ERK activation is transient,
	its activity declines before the c-Fos protein accumulates, and under
	these conditions c-Fos is unstable. However, when ERK signalling
	is sustained, c-Fos is phosphorylated by still-active ERK and RSK
	(90K-ribosomal S6 kinase). Carboxy-terminal phosphorylation stabilizes
	c-Fos and primes additional phosphorylation by exposing a docking
	site for ERK, termed the FXFP (DEF) domain. Mutating the DEF domain
	disrupts the c-Fos sensor and c-Fos-mediated signalling. Other immediate
	early gene products that control cell cycle progression, neuronal
	differentiation and circadium rhythms also contain putative DEF domains,
	indicating that multiple sensors exist for sustained ERK signalling.
	Together, our data identify a general mechanism by which cells can

	agents at higher doses. In this study, we determined the combined
	effect of celecoxib, a COX-2 inhibitor, along with exisulind (sulindac
	sulfone/Aptosyn) at low doses in prostate cancer. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN:
	We used a sequential regimen of N-methyl-N-nitrosourea + testosterone
	to induce prostate cancer in Wistar-Unilever rats. Following carcinogen
	treatment, celecoxib and exisulind individually and their combination
	at low doses were given in NIH-07 diet for 52 weeks. We determined
	the incidence of prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia, adenocarcinomas,
	rate of tumor cell proliferation, and apoptosis. Immunohistochemical
	and Western blot analysis were done to determine COX-2, epidermal
	growth factor receptor (EGFR), Akt, androgen receptor, and cyclin
	D1 expression. Serum prostaglandin E2 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha
	levels were determined using enzyme immunoassay/ELISA assays. RESULTS:
	The rats that received celecoxib in combination with exisulind at
	low doses showed a significant decrease in prostatic intraepithelial
	neoplasia and adenocarcinomas as well as an enhanced rate of apoptosis.
	An overall decrease in COX-2, EGFR, Akt, androgen receptor, and cyclin
	D1 expression was found associated with tumor growth inhibition.
	Reduced serum levels of COX-2 protein, prostaglandin E2, and tumor
	necrosis factor-alpha indicated anti-inflammatory effects. A strong
	inhibition of total and phosphorylated form of EGFR (Tyr(992) and
	Tyr(845)) and Akt (Ser(473)) was significant in rats given with these
	agents in combination. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we show for the
	first time that the combination of celecoxib with exisulind at low

	Abstract = {Robustness, a long-recognized property of living systems, allows function
	in the face of uncertainty while fragility, i.e., extreme sensitivity,
	can potentially lead to catastrophic failure following seemingly
	innocuous perturbations. Carlson and Doyle hypothesized that highly-evolved
	networks, e.g., those involved in cell-cycle regulation, can be resistant
	to some perturbations while highly sensitive to others. The "robust
	yet fragile" duality of networks has been termed Highly Optimized
	Tolerance (HOT) and has been the basis of new lines of inquiry in
	computational and experimental biology. In this study, we tested
	the working hypothesis that cell-cycle control architectures obey
	the HOT paradigm. Three cell-cycle models were analyzed using monte-carlo
	sensitivity analysis. Overall state sensitivity coefficients, which
	quantify the robustness or fragility of a given mechanism, were calculated
	using a monte-carlo strategy with three different numerical techniques
	along with multiple parameter perturbation strategies to control
	for possible numerical and sampling artifacts. Approximately 65\%
	of the mechanisms in the G1/S restriction point were responsible
	for 95\% of the sensitivity, conversely, the G2-DNA damage checkpoint
	showed a much stronger dependence on a few mechanisms; approximately
	32\% or 13 of 40 mechanisms accounted for 95\% of the sensitivity.
	Our analysis predicted that CDC25 and cyclin E mechanisms were strongly
	implicated in G1/S malfunctions, while fragility in the G2/M checkpoint
	was predicted to be associated with the regulation of the cyclin
	B-CDK1 complex. Analysis of a third model containing both G1/S and
	G2/M checkpoint logic, predicted in addition to mechanisms already
	mentioned, that translation and programmed proteolysis were also
	key fragile subsystems. Comparison of the predicted fragile mechanisms
	with literature and current preclinical and clinical trials suggested
	a strong correlation between efficacy and fragility. Thus, when taken
	together, these results support the working hypothesis that cell-cycle
	control architectures are HOT networks and establish the mathematical
	estimation and subsequent therapeutic exploitation of fragile mechanisms
	as a novel strategy for anti-cancer lead generation.},

	Abstract = {Aberrant activation of the androgen receptor through signaling pathways
	independent of androgen may be responsible for the progression of
	prostate tumors to the rapidly proliferating androgen-independent
	state. In this study, the effects of protein kinase A modulators
	on human androgen receptor activity were tested. Using an adenoviral
	DNA delivery system, we demonstrate that the androgen receptor can
	be activated by a protein kinase A activator, forskolin, in the absence
	of androgen when androgen receptor is co-transfected into monkey
	kidney CV1 cells or human prostate PC-3 cells with androgen-responsive
	reporters. Immunoblotting reveals that there is no significant change

	suggesting that the enhanced activity is due to activation of the
	receptor. This activation can be blocked by a protein kinase A inhibitor
	peptide. Two potent anti-androgens, casodex and flutamide, can significantly
	reduce this activation, confirming that the ligand-independent pathway
	is an androgen receptor-mediated phenomenon. An intact DNA binding

	most often by inducing MEK/ERK activation. A well-established model
	of CRAF regulation involves RAS-mediated translocation of CRAF to
	the plasma membrane, where it is activated by a series of events
	including phosphorylation. Here we have discovered a new mode of
	regulation that occurs prior to this step. By creating a kinase-defective
	version of CRAF in mice or by use of the RAF inhibitor sorafenib,
	we show that CRAF must first undergo autophosphorylation of serine
	621 (S621). Autophosphorylation occurs in cis, does not involve MEK/ERK
	activation, and is essential to ensure the correct folding and stability
	of the protein. In the absence of S621 phosphorylation, CRAF is degraded
	by the proteasome by mechanisms that do not uniquely rely on the

	the dynamics of androgenic synthesis, transport, metabolism, and
	regulation of the adult rodent ventral prostate was developed on
	the basis of a model by Barton and Anderson (1997). The model describes
	the systemic and local kinetics of testosterone (T), 5alpha-dihydrotestosterone

	by 5alpha-reductase in liver and prostate. Also included are feedback

	regulation of LH by T and DHT. The model simulates maintenance of
	the prostate as a function of hormone concentrations and androgen
	receptor (AR)-mediated signal transduction. The regulatory processes
	involved in prostate size and function include cell proliferation,
	apoptosis, fluid production, and 5alpha-reductase activity. Each
	process is controlled through the occupancy of a representative gene
	by androgen-AR dimers. The model simulates prostate dynamics for

	Abstract = {Spinal cord motoneurones express high levels of androgen receptor.
	However, in responsive tissue, the effects of testosterone is often
	mediated by the more potent androgenic derivative 5-alpha-dihydrotestosterone
	(DHT). This compound is formed in androgen target cells by the enzyme
	5-alpha-reductase. Two isoforms of the 5-alpha-reductase, with limited
	degree of homology, have been cloned, type 1 and type 2. The low
	affinity-constitutive type 1 isoenzyme is widely distributed in the
	body; the high affinity-androgen regulated 5-alpha-reductase type
	2 is confined to androgen-dependent structures and shows a peculiar
	pH optimum at acidic values. We have previously shown that high levels
	of 5-alpha-reductase activity are detectable in rat spinal cord.
	Here, using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, we show
	that both isoforms are expressed in the whole spinal cord of the
	rat. The enzymatic pH optimum measured in immortalized spinal cord
	motoneurones (NSC34) is typical of the type 2 isoenzyme. Using in
	situ hybridization technique, we found that 5-alpha-reductase type

	Abstract = {Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) mRNA was detected by in situ hybridization
	utilizing a 428 base pair [35S]-labelled cDNA probe from the 3' noncoding
	region of the PSA gene. Thirty six fresh surgical specimens were
	collected from patients undergoing radical retropubic prostatectomy
	for carcinoma of the prostate. Quantitative analysis of the levels
	of PSA mRNA in both the benign and malignant tissues was performed
	using an IBAS 2000 Image Analysis System. The results of this study
	demonstrated that there is a significant decrease in the expression
	of PSA mRNA in the carcinoma tissue when compared to the benign epithelium.
	The average binding (number of silver grains/1 x 10(4) microns. 2)
	for 20 specimens of malignant epithelium was 475 +/- 161 and 586
	+/- 140 for 16 specimens of benign epithelium (p less than 0.05).
	Eleven patients had both benign and malignant tissue from the same
	surgical specimen available for study. From these paired specimens,
	the PSA mRNA expression was also significantly reduced in the malignant
	epithelium when compared to the benign epithelium, 445 +/- 162 and
	588 +/- 135 respectively (p less than 0.005). The PSA protein was
	detected using a monoclonal antibody to PSA with an immunohistochemical
	staining technique. The PSA protein expression paralleled the expression
	of the PSA mRNA in the majority of the tissue sections. Many of the
	tumor specimens showed a heterogeneous expression of PSA, whereas
	all of the benign epithelium had a uniform high level of PSA expression.
	In conclusion, PSA mRNA and protein are located only within the glandular
	epithelial tissue, the expression of PSA protein parallels that of
	the PSA mRNA, and both the PSA protein and PSA mRNA are significantly
	decreased in the malignant epithelium when compared to benign prostatic
	epithelium.},

	interacts with and downregulates PP2A(Cdc55), thereby facilitating
	Cdk-dependent Net1 phosphorylation. PP2A(Cdc55) downregulation also
	promotes phosphorylation of Bfa1, contributing to activation of the

	regulates myeloid and monocytic differentiation of HL-60 myeloblastic
	leukemia cells in response to retinoic acid (RA) and vitamin D3 (D3),
	respectively. Both RA and D3 decreased the expression of PDGFR-alpha

	with the PDGFR inhibitor AG1296 in addition to RA or D3, signs of
	terminal differentiation such as inducible oxidative metabolism and

	by an increased extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 activation.
	AG1296 also resulted in elevated expression of differentiation markers
	CD11b and CD66c when administered with RA or D3. Interestingly, other
	markers did not follow the same pattern. Cells receiving AG1296 in
	addition to RA or D3 showed decreased G1-G0 arrest and CD14, CD38,
	and CD89 expression. We thus provide evidence that certain sets of
	differentiation markers can be enhanced, whereas others can be inhibited
	by the PDGFR pathway. In addition, we found calcium levels to be
	decreased by RA and D3 but increased when AG1296 was given in addition
	to RA or D3, suggesting that calcium levels decrease during myeloid
	or monocytic differentiation, and elevated calcium levels can disturb
	the expression of certain differentiation markers.},

	Abstract = {Expression of prostate-specific antigen (PA) mRNA was tested at various
	time periods after incubation of the human prostate tumor cell line
	LNCaP with the synthetic androgen R1881. Androgen-stimulated expression
	was observed within 6 h after addition of R1881 to the cells. Run-on
	experiments with nuclei isolated from LNCaP cells showed that expression
	of the PA gene could be regulated by R1881 on the level of transcription.
	DNase I footprints of the promoter region of the PA gene (-320 to
	+12) with nuclear protein extracts from LNCaP cells showed at least
	four protected regions. The protected areas include the TATA-box,
	a GC-box sequence, and a sequence AGAACAgcaAGTGCT at position -170
	to -156, which closely resembles the reverse complement of the consensus
	sequence GGTACAnnnTGTTCT for binding of the glucocorticoid receptor
	and the progesterone receptor. Fragments of the PA promoter region
	were cloned in front of the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT)
	reporter gene and cotransfected with an androgen receptor expression
	plasmid into COS cells in a transient expression assay. CAT activity
	of COS cells grown in the presence of 1 nM R1881 was compared to
	untreated controls. A 110-fold induction of CAT activity was found
	if a -1600 to +12 PA promoter fragment was used in the construct.
	By further deletion mapping of the PA promoter a minimal region (-320
	to -155) was identified as being essential for androgen-regulated
	gene expression. Mutation of the sequence AGAACAgcaAGTGCT (at -170
	to -156) to AAAAAAgcaAGTGCT almost completely abolished androgen
	inducibility of the reporter gene constructs. One or more copies
	of the sequence AGAACAgcaAGTGCT cloned in front of a thymidine kinase
	promoter-CAT reporter gene confers androgen regulation to the reporter
	gene. These findings provide strong evidence for transcription regulation
	of the PA gene by androgens via the sequence AGAACAgcaAGTGCT. Interestingly,
	in addition to the AGAACAgcaAGTGCT element, an upstream region (-539
	to -320) is needed for optimal androgen inducibility of the PA promoter.},

	to maximally facilitate ERK cascade signaling and contributes to
	the regulation of Raf kinase activity. Binding of the CK2 holoenzyme
	is constitutive and requires the basic surface region of the KSR1
	atypical C1 domain. Loss of CK2 binding does not alter the membrane
	translocation of KSR1 or its interaction with ERK cascade components;
	however, disruption of the KSR1/CK2 interaction or inhibition of
	CK2 activity significantly reduces the growth-factor-induced phosphorylation
	of C-Raf and B-Raf on the activating serine site in the negative-charge
	regulatory region (N-region). This decrease in Raf N-region phosphorylation
	further correlates with impaired Raf, MEK, and ERK activation. These
	findings identify CK2 as a novel component of the KSR1 scaffolding
	complex that facilitates ERK cascade signaling by functioning as
	a Raf family N-Region kinase.},

	Abstract = {The serine/threonine protein kinase c-Raf-1 interacts with a number
	of cellular proteins including 14-3-3 isoforms which may be regulators
	or substrates of c-Raf-1 in signal transduction pathways. In vivo
	and in vitro binding analyses of c-Raf-1 and mutant proteins with
	14-3-3 zeta indicate bivalent binding of 14-3-3 zeta to the amino
	terminus as well as to the carboxy terminus of c-Raf-1. Although
	14-3-3 zeta and Ras use different binding regions on the amino terminal
	regulatory domain of c-Raf-1 (c-Raf-NT), 14-3-3 zeta is displaced
	from the amino terminus upon binding of activated Ras. In contrast,
	if c-Raf-1 full length is analysed instead of the separately expressed
	c-Raf-NT, binding of 14-3-3 zeta is only slightly effected by co-expression
	of activated Ras. This is explained by a second binding site of 14-3-3
	zeta at the carboxy terminus of c-Raf-1. The mutant c-Raf-NT (S259A)
	cannot bind 14-3-3 zeta, suggesting a regulatory role of this in
	vivo phosphorylation site. However, c-Raf-NT phosphorylated or unphosphorylated
	at S259, is able to bind 14-3-3 zeta. Even though 14-3-3 zeta can
	be phosphorylated in vivo, only the unphosphorylated form binds to
	the amino terminus of c-Raf-1. The data presented indicate, that
	14-3-3 zeta binds to c-Raf-1 in a bivalent fashion in unstimulated
	cells. 14-3-3 zeta is displaced from the amino terminus but not from
	the carboxy terminus of c-Raf-1 by binding of activated Ras to c-Raf-1.},

	Abstract = {To improve the therapy for prostate cancer, it will be necessary to
	address the problems of progression to androgen independence and
	the process of metastatic spread of tumour. The complexity of the
	latter condition is likely to mitigate against the immediate development
	of relevant therapeutic approaches. However, the basis of androgen
	independence appears to be a problem of simpler dimensions and more
	amenable to treatment with current therapeutic technology. Since
	early tumour progression can be detected by an incomplete prostate-specific
	antigen (PSA) response to androgen withdrawal therapy, a study of
	the molecular biology of PSA gene regulation may well provide insight
	into new methods for preventing or delaying this problem. Mounting
	evidence suggests that ligand-independent activation of the androgen
	receptor may be one underlying mechanism of androgen independence.
	In the absence of androgen, a compensatory increase in the activity
	of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) enhances the ability of the
	androgen receptor to bind to the response elements regulating PSA
	gene expression. The activation of the androgen receptor through
	up-regulation of the PKA signal transduction pathway involves the
	amino-terminus of the androgen receptor, the function of which may
	be altered either by modifications such as phosphorylation, or through
	interactions with co-regulators or other proteins. Of therapeutic
	interest is the fact that this effect can be counteracted experimentally
	by the anti-androgen, bicalutamide, and clinically by several other
	similar agents. We speculate that the inhibition of PKA-activated
	androgen receptor might also be accomplished by decoy molecules that
	can bind to the relevant activated site on the amino-terminus or
	competitively interact with proteins recruited by the PKA pathway
	that are responsible for activating the receptor in the absence of
	androgen. Such molecules might include small mimetic substances or
	agents that can gain access to the nucleus of the cell.},

	Abstract = {The neu protooncogene (also known as c-erbB2, NGL, and HER2) encodes
	a 185-kDa transmembrane glycoprotein with intrinsic tyrosine kinase
	activity that resembles the receptor for epidermal growth factor.
	The p185 gene and protein were originally identified in the brain
	and are thought to play a critical role in neurogenesis. Aberrant
	c-erbB2 protein overexpression also occurs in several human adenocarcinomas.
	A ligand for p185, neu-activating factor (NAF), specifically binds
	to neu receptor and increases the p185c-neu tyrosine phosphorylation
	in vitro and in vivo in a dose-dependent manner. We now show that
	NAF specifically binds to purified p185 expressed in baculovirus.
	Direct binding analysis showed that NAF binds with high affinity
	(Kd = 1.3 nM). We have investigated changes in the structure and
	association state of baculovirus-produced neu holoreceptor that are
	induced by ligand binding. In this study, we used sucrose gradients
	to show that purified p185c-neu exists mainly in the monomeric form
	at low concentrations, whereas at higher concentrations p185c-neu
	exists as dimers or multimers. At low concentrations, but in the
	presence of ligand, p185c-neu sediments as a dimeric or multimeric
	form. Monomer-oligomer interconversion is absolutely ligand dependent
	at low receptor concentrations. The high molecular weight form of
	the receptor is enzymatically more active, as a consequence of ligand-driven
	activation of the receptor kinase. Oncogenic p185neu receptors sediment
	predominantly as high molecular weight forms and have constitutively

	Abstract = {The androgen receptor (AR) is a member of the nuclear receptor (NR)
	superfamily that mediates the effects of androgens on target tissues.
	Over the last decade, it has become apparent that NRs require accessory
	factors for optimal activation of target gene expression. Numerous
	NR coregulators have been identified, with diverse structures and
	potential mechanisms of coregulation, creating an increasingly complicated
	picture of NR action. Due to the expanding complexity of the coregulator
	field, this review will focus on the AR ligand-binding domain (LBD)
	and N-terminal interacting proteins identified by our lab. The LBD-interacting
	proteins ARA70, ARA55 and ARA54 were first characterized and ARA70
	was found to have a relatively higher specificity for the AR in human
	prostate cancer DU145 cells. Characterization of the functional relationship
	between the AR and these coregulators indicated that ARA70 and ARA55
	could enhance the androgenic effects of 17beta-estradiol (E2) and
	hydroxyflutamide (HF), an antiandrogen commonly used in the treatment
	of prostate cancer. ARA160, an AR N-terminal interacting protein
	also known as TATA element modulatory factor (TMF), was subsequently
	shown to cooperate with ARA70 in enhancing AR activity. Another AR
	N-terminal interacting protein, ARA24, interacted with the poly-Q
	tract, a region within the N-terminus of the AR linked to Kennedy's
	disease (X-linked spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy). More recently,
	our lab has identified ARA267, a SET domain containing protein, and
	supervillin, an F-actin binding protein, as AR coregulators. Collectively,
	the data from these studies indicate that these coregulators are
	necessary for optimal AR transactivation. Interruption of the interaction
	between AR and these proteins may serve as a new therapeutic target
	in the treatment of prostate cancer.},

@article{Seger1995,
	Abstract = {The transmission of extracellular signals into their intracellular
	targets is mediated by a network of interacting proteins that regulate
	a large number of cellular processes. Cumulative efforts from many
	laboratories over the past decade have allowed the elucidation of
	one such signaling mechanism, which involves activations of several
	membranal signaling molecules followed by a sequential stimulation
	of several cytoplasmic protein kinases collectively known as mitogen-activated
	protein kinase (MAPK) signaling cascade. Up to six tiers in this
	cascade contribute to the amplification and specificity of the transmitted
	signals that eventually activate several regulatory molecules in
	the cytoplasm and in the nucleus to initiate cellular processes such
	as proliferation, differentiation, and development. Moreover, because
	many oncogenes have been shown to encode proteins that transmit mitogenic
	signals upstream of this cascade, the MAPK pathway provides a simple
	unifying explanation for the mechanism of action of most, if not
	all, nonnuclear oncogenes. The pattern of MAPK cascade is not restricted
	to growth factor signaling and it is now known that signaling pathways
	initiated by phorbol esters, ionophors, heat shock, and ligands for
	seven transmembrane receptors use distinct MAPK cascades with little
	or no cross-reactivity between them. In this review we emphasize
	primarily the first MAPK cascade to be discovered that uses the MEK
	and ERK isoforms and describe their involvement in different cellular
	processes.},

	Abstract = {The microbially derived antiproliferative agent rapamycin inhibits
	cell growth by interfering with the signaling functions of the mammalian
	target of rapamycin (mTOR). In this study, we demonstrate that interleukin-3
	stimulation induces a wortmannin-sensitive increase in mTOR kinase
	activity in a myeloid progenitor cell line. The involvement of phosphoinositide
	3'-kinase (PI3K) in the regulation of mTOR activity was further suggested
	by findings that mTOR was phosphorylated in vitro and in vivo by
	the PI3K-regulated protein kinase, AKT/PKB. Although AKT phosphorylated
	mTOR at two COOH-terminal sites (Thr2446 and Ser2448) in vitro, Ser2448
	was the major phosphorylation site in insulin-stimulated or -activated
	AKT-expressing human embryonic kidney cells. Transient transfection
	assays with mTOR mutants bearing Ala substitutions at Ser2448 and/or
	Thr2446 indicated that AKT-dependent mTOR phosphorylation was not
	essential for either PHAS-I phosphorylation or p70S6K activation
	in HEK cells. However, a deletion of amino acids 2430-2450 in mTOR,
	which includes the potential AKT phosphorylation sites, significantly
	increased both the basal protein kinase activity and in vivo signaling
	functions of mTOR. These results demonstrate that mTOR is a direct
	target of the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway in mitogen-stimulated cells,
	and that the identified AKT phosphorylation sites are nested within
	a "repressor domain" that negatively regulates the catalytic activity
	of mTOR. Furthermore, the activation status of the PI3K-AKT pathway
	in cancer cells may be an important determinant of cellular sensitivity
	to the cytostatic effect of rapamycin.},

	Abstract = {Retinoic acid (RA) causes HL-60 human myeloblastic leukemia cell myeloid
	differentiation that is dependent on MAPK signaling. The process
	is propelled by c-Cbl, which binds the CD38 receptor as part of a
	signaling complex generating MAPK signaling. Here we report that
	the capability of c-Cbl to do this is lost in the G306E tyrosine
	kinase-binding domain mutant. Unlike wild-type (WT) c-Cbl, the G306E
	mutant c-Cbl fails to propel RA-induced differentiation, and disrupts
	the normal association with CD38. The G306E mutant does, like WT
	c-Cbl, co-immunoprecipitate with Vav, Slp-76, and p38. But unlike
	WT c-Cbl, does not cause MAPK signaling. In contrast, the C381A Ring
	finger domain mutant functions like WT c-Cbl. It binds CD38 and is
	part of the same apparent c-Cbl/Slp-76/Vav/p38 signaling complex.
	The C381A mutant causes MAPK signaling and propels RA-induced differentiation.
	In addition to HL-60 cells and their WT or mutant c-Cbl stable transfectants,
	the c-Cbl/Vav/Slp-76 complex is also found in NB4 cells where c-Cbl
	was previously also found to bind CD38. The data are consistent with
	a model in which the G306E mutant c-Cbl forms a signaling complex
	that includes Slp-76, Vav, and p38; but does not drive MAPK signaling
	because it fails to bind the CD38 receptor. Without the G306E mutation
	the c-Cbl unites CD38 with the signaling complex and delivers a MAPK
	signal that drives RA-induced differentiation. The results demonstrate
	the importance of the Gly306 residue in the ability of c-Cbl to propel

	Abstract = {Kinetic properties of the purified alpha, beta, and gamma subspecies
	of protein kinase C (PKC) to respond to diacylglycerol, phosphatidylserine
	(PtdSer), and Ca2+ were reinvestigated in the presence of several
	fatty acids. Although responses of these enzyme subspecies to the
	lipids slightly differed from one another, the reaction velocity
	of these subspecies was significantly enhanced by synergistic action
	of diacylglycerol and a cis-unsaturated fatty acid. Arachidonic,
	oleic, linoleic, linolenic, and docosahexaenoic acids were active
	in this role, whereas saturated fatty acids such as palmitic and
	stearic acids were inactive. Elaidic acid was also inactive. In the
	presence of both PtdSer and diacylglycerol, the cis-unsaturated fatty
	acids increased further an apparent affinity of PKC to Ca2+ and allowed
	the enzyme to exhibit almost full activation at nearly basal levels
	of Ca2+ concentration. The concentration of fatty acid giving rise
	to the maximum activation of enzyme was approximately 20-50 microM.
	The result presented herein implies that the receptor-mediated release
	of unsaturated fatty acids from phospholipids may take part, in synergy
	with diacylglycerol, in the activation of PKC even when the Ca2+
	concentration is low. A possibility arises, then, that the activation
	of PKC is an integral part of the signal-induced degradation cascade
	of various membrane phospholipids, which is initiated by the actions
	of phospholipase C and phospholipase A2.},

	tyrosine phosphorylation of Vav. Immunoprecipitation of Vav from
	activated cells revealed co-immunoprecipitated phosphoproteins of
	molecular weights identical to the FcepsilonRI beta and gamma chains,
	and the former was reactive with antibody to the FcepsilonRI beta
	chain. Conversely, Western blots revealed the presence of p95 Vav
	in FcepsilonRI immunoprecipitates. The association of Vav and of
	Grb2 with the receptor was found to be regulated by aggregation of
	the receptor, and the interaction of Vav with the FcepsilonRI was
	localized to the gamma chain. To gain insight on the signaling pathway
	in which Vav participates, we investigated the in vivo associations
	of Vav with other molecules. A reducible chemical cross-linking agent
	was used to covalently maintain protein interactions under nonreducing
	conditions. A fraction of Vav increased in mass to form a complex
	of >300 kDa in molecular mass. Under reducing conditions the cross-linked
	Vav immunoprecipitates showed the presence of Grb2, Raf-1, and p42(mapk)
	(ERK2). In vitro kinase assays of Raf-1 activity associated with
	Vav revealed that this complex had an activity greater than that
	of Raf-1 derived from nonactivated cells, and aggregation of the
	FcepsilonRI did not modulate this activity. In contrast, aggregation
	of the FcepsilonRI increased the total Raf-1 activity by 2-5-fold.
	These results demonstrate that Vav associates constitutively with
	components of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway to form
	an active multimeric signaling complex whose in vivo activity and
	associations may be directed by aggregation of the FcepsilonRI. The
	findings of this study may also be relevant to other members of the

	Abstract = {Intracellular calcium dynamics are critical to cellular functions

	in modulating intracellular calcium levels by interacting with the
	P2 family of surface receptors. In this study, we developed a mechanistic
	mathematical model of ATP-induced P2 mediated calcium signaling in
	archetype sensory neurons. The model architecture, which described
	90 species connected by 162 interactions, was formulated by aggregating
	disparate molecular modules from literature. Unlike previous models,
	only mass action kinetics were used to describe the rate of molecular
	interactions. Thus, the majority of the 252 unknown model parameters
	were either association, dissociation or catalytic rate constants.
	Model parameters were estimated from nine independent data sets taken
	from multiple laboratories. The training data consisted of both dynamic
	and steady-state measurements. However, because of the complexity
	of the calcium network, we were unable to estimate unique model parameters.
	Instead, we estimated a family or ensemble of probable parameter

	of the ensemble met an error criterion and was located along or near

@article{Soni2008,
	Abstract = {Activation of translation initiation is essential for the malignant
	phenotype and is emerging as a potential therapeutic target. Translation
	is regulated by the expression of translation initiation factor 4E
	(eIF4E) as well as the interaction of eIF4E with eIF4E-binding proteins
	(e.g., 4E-BP1). Rapamycin inhibits translation initiation by decreasing
	the phosphorylation of 4E-BP1, increasing eIF4E/4E-BP1 interaction.
	However, rapamycin also inhibits S6K phosphorylation, leading to
	feedback loop activation of Akt. We hypothesized that targeting eIF4E
	directly would inhibit breast cancer cell growth without activating
	Akt. We showed that eIF4E is ubiquitously expressed in breast cancer
	cell lines. eIF4E knockdown by small interfering RNA inhibited growth
	in different breast cancer cell subtypes including triple-negative
	(estrogen receptor/progesterone receptor/HER-2-negative) cancer cells.
	eIF4E knockdown inhibited the growth of cells with varying total
	and phosphorylated 4E-BP1 levels and inhibited rapamycin-insensitive
	as well as rapamycin-sensitive cell lines. eIF4E knockdown led to
	a decrease in expression of cyclin D1, Bcl-2, and Bcl-xL. eIF4E knockdown
	did not lead to Akt phosphorylation but did decrease 4E-BP1 expression.
	We conclude that eIF4E is a promising target for breast cancer therapy.
	eIF4E-targeted therapy may be efficacious in a variety of breast
	cancer subtypes including triple-negative tumors for which currently
	there are no targeted therapies. Unlike rapamycin and its analogues,
	eIF4E knockdown is not associated with Akt activation.},

	Abstract = {We apply a mathematical model for receptor-mediated cell uptake and
	processing of epidermal growth factor (EGF) to analyze and predict
	proliferation responses to fibroblastic cells transfected with various
	forms of the EGF receptor (EGFR) to EGF. The underlying conceptual
	hypothesis is that the mitogenic signal generated by EGF/EGFR binding
	on the cell surface, via stimulation of receptor tyrosine kinase
	activity, is attenuated when the receptors are downregulated and
	growth factor is depleted by endocytic internalization and subsequent
	intracellular degradation. Hence, the cell proliferation rate ought
	to depend on receptor/ligand binding and trafficking parameters as
	well as on intrinsic receptor signal transduction properties. The
	goal of our modeling efforts is to formulate this hypothesis in quantitative
	terms. The mathematical model consists of kinetic equations for binding,
	internalization, degradation, and recycling of EGF and EGFR, along
	with an expression relating DNA synthesis rate to EGF/EGFR complex
	levels. Parameter values have been previously determined from independent
	binding and trafficking kinetic experiments on B82 fibroblasts transfected
	with wild-type and mutant EGFR. We show that this model can successfully
	interpret literature data for EGF-dependent growth of NR6 fibroblasts
	transfected with wild-type EGFR. Moreover, it successfully predicts
	the literature observation that NR6 cells transfected with a delta
	973 truncation mutant EGFR, which is kinase-active but internalization-deficient,
	require an order of magnitude lower EGF concentration than cells
	with wild-type EGFR for half-maximal proliferation rate. This result
	demonstrates that it may be feasible to genetically engineer mammalian
	cell lines with reduced growth factor requirements by a rational,
	nonempirical approach. We explore by further model computations the
	possibility of exploiting other varieties of EGFR mutants to alter
	growth properties of fibroblastic cells, based on relationships between
	changes in the primary structure of the EGF receptor and the rates
	of specific receptor/ligand binding and trafficking processes. Our
	studies show that the ability to predict cell proliferation as a
	function of serum growth factors such as EGF could lead to the designed
	development of cells with optimized growth responses. This approach
	may also aid in elucidation of mechanisms underlying loss of normal
	cell proliferation control in malignant transformation, by demonstrating
	that receptor trafficking dynamics may in some cases play as important
	a role as intrinsic signal transduction in determining the overall
	resulting mitogenic response.},

	Abstract = {Robustness, a relative insensitivity to perturbations, is a key characteristic
	of living cells. However, the specific structural characteristics
	that are responsible for robust performance are not clear, even in
	genetic circuits of moderate complexity. Formal sensitivity analysis
	allows the investigation of robustness and fragility properties of
	mathematical models representing regulatory networks, but it yields
	only local properties with respect to a particular choice of parameter
	values. Here, we show that by systematically investigating the parameter
	space, more global properties linked to network structure can be
	derived. Our analysis focuses on the genetic oscillator responsible
	for generating circadian rhythms in Drosophila as a prototypic dynamical
	cellular system. Analysis of two mathematical models of moderate
	complexity shows that the tradeoff between robustness and fragility
	is largely determined by the regulatory structure. Rank-ordered sensitivities,
	for instance, allow the correct identification of protein phosphorylation
	as an influential process determining the oscillator's period. Furthermore,
	sensitivity analysis confirms the theoretical insight that hierarchical
	control might be important for achieving robustness. The complex

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Mitoxantrone plus prednisone reduces pain and improves
	the quality of life in men with advanced, hormone-refractory prostate
	cancer, but it does not improve survival. We compared such treatment
	with docetaxel plus prednisone in men with this disease. METHODS:
	From March 2000 through June 2002, 1006 men with metastatic hormone-refractory
	prostate cancer received 5 mg of prednisone twice daily and were
	randomly assigned to receive 12 mg of mitoxantrone per square meter
	of body-surface area every three weeks, 75 mg of docetaxel per square
	meter every three weeks, or 30 mg of docetaxel per square meter weekly
	for five of every six weeks. The primary end point was overall survival.
	Secondary end points were pain, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels,
	and the quality of life. All statistical comparisons were against
	mitoxantrone. RESULTS: As compared with the men in the mitoxantrone
	group, men in the group given docetaxel every three weeks had a hazard
	ratio for death of 0.76 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.62 to
	0.94; P=0.009 by the stratified log-rank test) and those given weekly
	docetaxel had a hazard ratio for death of 0.91 (95 percent confidence
	interval, 0.75 to 1.11; P=0.36). The median survival was 16.5 months
	in the mitoxantrone group, 18.9 months in the group given docetaxel
	every 3 weeks, and 17.4 months in the group given weekly docetaxel.
	Among these three groups, 32 percent, 45 percent, and 48 percent
	of men, respectively, had at least a 50 percent decrease in the serum
	PSA level (P<0.001 for both comparisons with mitoxantrone); 22 percent,
	35 percent (P=0.01), and 31 percent (P=0.08) had predefined reductions
	in pain; and 13 percent, 22 percent (P=0.009), and 23 percent (P=0.005)
	had improvements in the quality of life. Adverse events were also
	more common in the groups that received docetaxel. CONCLUSIONS: When
	given with prednisone, treatment with docetaxel every three weeks
	led to superior survival and improved rates of response in terms
	of pain, serum PSA level, and quality of life, as compared with mitoxantrone
	plus prednisone.},

	Abstract = {Androgen ablation therapy is currently the primary treatment for metastatic
	prostate cancer. Unfortunately, in nearly all cases, androgen ablation
	fails to permanently arrest cancer progression. As androgens like
	testosterone are withdrawn, prostate cancer cells lose their androgen
	sensitivity and begin to proliferate without hormone growth factors.
	In this study, we constructed and analyzed a mathematical model of
	the integration between hormone growth factor signaling, androgen
	receptor activation, and the expression of cyclin D and Prostate-Specific
	Antigen in human LNCaP prostate adenocarcinoma cells. The objective
	of the study was to investigate which signaling systems were important
	in the loss of androgen dependence. The model was formulated as a
	set of ordinary differential equations which described 212 species
	and 384 interactions, including both the mRNA and protein levels
	for key species. An ensemble approach was chosen to constrain model
	parameters and to estimate the impact of parametric uncertainty on
	model predictions. Model parameters were identified using 14 steady-state
	and dynamic LNCaP data sets taken from literature sources. Alterations
	in the rate of Prostatic Acid Phosphatase expression was sufficient
	to capture varying levels of androgen dependence. Analysis of the
	model provided insight into the importance of network components
	as a function of androgen dependence. The importance of androgen
	receptor availability and the MAPK/Akt signaling axes was independent
	of androgen status. Interestingly, androgen receptor availability
	was important even in androgen-independent LNCaP cells. Translation
	became progressively more important in androgen-independent LNCaP
	cells. Further analysis suggested a positive synergy between the
	MAPK and Akt signaling axes and the translation of key proliferative
	markers like cyclin D in androgen-independent cells. Taken together,
	the results support the targeting of both the Akt and MAPK pathways.
	Moreover, the analysis suggested that direct targeting of the translational
	machinery, specifically eIF4E, could be efficacious in androgen-independent
	prostate cancers.},

	Abstract = {Manipulation of differentiation programs has therapeutic potential
	in a spectrum of human cancers and neurodegenerative disorders. In
	this study, we integrated computational and experimental methods
	to unravel the response of a lineage uncommitted precursor cell-line,
	HL-60, to Retinoic Acid (RA). HL-60 is a human myeloblastic leukemia
	cell-line used extensively to study human differentiation programs.
	Initially, we focused on the role of the BLR1 receptor in RA-induced
	differentiation and G1/0-arrest in HL-60. BLR1, a putative G protein-coupled
	receptor expressed following RA exposure, is required for RA-induced
	cell-cycle arrest and differentiation and causes persistent MAPK
	signaling. A mathematical model of RA-induced cell-cycle arrest and
	differentiation was formulated and tested against BLR1 wild-type
	(wt) knock-out and knock-in HL-60 cell-lines with and without RA.
	The current model described the dynamics of 729 proteins and protein
	complexes interconnected by 1356 interactions. An ensemble strategy
	was used to compensate for uncertain model parameters. The ensemble
	of HL-60 models recapitulated the positive feedback between BLR1
	and MAPK signaling. The ensemble of models also correctly predicted
	Rb and p47phox regulation and the correlation between p21-CDK4-cyclin
	D formation and G1/0-arrest following exposure to RA. Finally, we
	investigated the robustness of the HL-60 network architecture to
	structural perturbations and generated experimentally testable hypotheses
	for future study. Taken together, the model presented here was a
	first step toward a systematic framework for analysis of programmed
	differentiation. These studies also demonstrated that mechanistic
	network modeling can help prioritize experimental directions by generating
	falsifiable hypotheses despite uncertainty.},

	Expression of dominant negative forms of 14-3-3 resulted in the loss

	its potential activity in the cell. Phosphorylation of Raf-1, however,
	was insufficient by itself for kinase activity. Removal of 14-3-3
	from phosphorylated Raf abrogated kinase activity, whereas addition
	of 14-3-3 restored it. This supports a paradigm in which the effects

	Abstract = {The role of guanine nucleotides in ras p21 function was determined
	by using the ability of p21 protein to induce maturation of Xenopus
	oocytes as a quantitative assay for biological activity. Two oncogenic
	mutant human N-ras p21 proteins, Asp12 and Val12, actively induced
	maturation, whereas normal Gly12 p21 was relatively inactive in this
	assay. Both mutant proteins were found to be associated with guanosine
	triphosphate (GTP) in vivo. In contrast, Gly12 p21 was predominantly
	guanosine diphosphate (GDP)-bound because of a dramatic stimulation
	of Gly12 p21-associated guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase) activity.
	A cytoplasmic protein was shown to be responsible for this increase
	in activity. This protein stimulated GTP hydrolysis by purified Gly12
	p21 more than 200-fold in vitro, but had no effect on Asp12 or Val12
	mutants. A similar factor could be detected in extracts from mammalian
	cells. It thus appears that, in Xenopus oocytes, this protein maintains
	normal p21 in a biologically inactive, GDP-bound state through its
	effect on GTPase activity. Furthermore, it appears that the major

	Abstract = {Stimulation of PC12 cells with nerve growth factor (NGF) increased
	mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MAPKK) activity > 20-fold
	after 5 min to a level that was largely sustained for at least 90
	min. MAPKK activity was stimulated to a similar level by epidermal
	growth factor (EGF), but peaked at 2 min, declining thereafter and
	returning to basal levels after 60-90 min. Activation of MAPKK by
	either growth factor occurred prior to the activation of MAP kinase,
	consistent with MAPKK being the physiological activator of MAP kinase.
	The results demonstrate that the transient activation of MAPKK by
	EGF and its sustained activation by NGF underlies the transient and
	sustained activation of MAP kinase induced by EGF and NGF respectively.
	NGF or EGF induced the same two forms of MAPKK that were resolved
	on a Mono Q column. The Peak-1 MAPKK was activated initially and
	partially converted into the more acidic peak-2 MAPKK after prolonged
	growth-factor stimulation. The Peak-2 MAPKK was 20-fold more sensitive
	to inactivation by the catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase 2A.
	Stimulation with NGF caused a striking translocation of MAP kinase
	from the cytosol to the nucleus after 30 min, but not nuclear translocation
	of MAP kinase occurred after stimulation with EGF. The results suggest
	that sustained activation of the MAP kinase cascade may be required
	for MAP kinase to enter the nucleus, where it may initiate the gene

	Abstract = {cRaf-1 is a mitogen-activated protein kinase that is the main effector
	recruited by GTP-bound Ras in order to activate the MAP kinase pathway.
	Inactive Raf is found in the cytosol in a complex with Hsp90, Hsp50
	(Cdc37) and the 14-3-3 proteins. GTP-bound Ras binds Raf and is necessary
	but not sufficient for the stable activation of Raf that occurs in
	response to serum, epidermal growth factor, platelet-derived growth
	factor or insulin. These agents cause a two- to threefold increase
	in overall phosphorylation of Raf on serine/threonine residues, and
	treatment of cRaf-1 with protein (serine/threonine) phosphatases
	can deactivate it, at least partially. The role of 14-3-3 proteins
	in the regulation of Raf's kinase activity is uncertain and is investigated
	here. Active Raf can be almost completely deactivated in vitro by
	displacement of 14-3-3 using synthetic phosphopeptides. Deactivation
	can be substantially reversed by addition of purified recombinant
	bacterial 14-3-3; however, Raf must have been previously activated
	in vivo to be reactivated by 14-3-3 in vitro. The ability of 14-3-3
	to support Raf activity is dependent on phosphorylation of serine
	residues on Raf and on the integrity of the 14-3-3 dimer; mutant
	monomeric forms of 14-3-3, although able to bind Raf in vivo, do
	not enable Raf to be activated in vivo or restore Raf activity after
	displacement of 14-3-3 in vitro. The 14-3-3 protein is not required
	to induce dimerization of Raf. We propose that dimeric 14-3-3 is
	needed both to maintain Raf in an inactive state in the absence of
	GTP-bound Ras and to stabilize an active conformation of Raf produced
	during activation in vivo.},

	Abstract = {Human prostatic acid phosphatase (PAcP) was used as a valuable surrogate
	marker for monitoring prostate cancer prior to the availability of
	prostate-specific antigen (PSA). Even though the level of PAcP is
	increased in the circulation of prostate cancer patients, its intracellular
	level and activity are greatly diminished in prostate cancer cells.
	Recent advances in understanding the function of the cellular form
	of PAcP (cPAcP) have shed some light on its role in prostate carcinogenesis,
	which may have potential applications for prostate cancer therapy.
	It is now evident that cPAcP functions as a neutral protein tyrosine
	phosphatase (PTP) in prostate cancer cells and dephosphorylates HER-2/ErbB-2/Neu
	(HER-2: human epidermal growth factor receptor-2) at the phosphotyrosine
	(p-Tyr) residues. Dephosphorylation of HER-2 at its p-Tyr residues
	results in the down-regulation of its specific activity, which leads
	to decreases in growth and tumorigenicity of those cancer cells.
	Conversely, decreased cPAcP expression correlates with hyperphosphorylation
	of HER-2 at tyrosine residues and activation of downstream extracellular
	signal-regulated kinase (ERK)/mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK)
	signaling, which results in prostate cancer progression as well as
	androgen-independent growth of prostate cancer cells. These in vitro
	results on the effect of cPAcP on androgen-independent growth of
	prostate cancer cells corroborate the clinical findings that cPAcP
	level is greatly decreased in advanced prostate cancer and provide
	insights into one of the molecular mechanisms involved in prostate
	cancer progression. Results from experiments using xenograft animal
	models further indicate a novel role of cPAcP as a tumor suppressor.
	Future studies are warranted to clarify the use of cPAcP as a therapeutic
	agent in human prostate cancer patients.},

	Abstract = {MAPK signaling is required for retinoic acid (RA)-triggered G(0) cell
	cycle arrest and cell differentiation, but the mechanism is not well
	defined. In this study, RA is found to cause MAPK activation with
	sustained association of RAF to MEK or ERK, leading to a MAPK-dependent
	accumulation of p21(Waf1/Cip1) and binding to CDK2 blocking G(1)/S
	transition. BLR1, a chemokine receptor, was found to function as
	a critical component of RA-triggered MAPK signaling. Unlike wild-type
	parental cells, RA-treated BLR1 knock-out cells failed to show RAF
	and consequential MEK and ERK phosphorylation, failed to accumulate
	CDK inhibitors that control G(1)/S transition, and failed to differentiate
	and arrest in response to RA, whereas ectopically overexpressing
	BLR1 enhanced MAPK signaling and caused accelerated RA-induced differentiation
	and arrest. Ectopic overexpression of RAF enhanced BLR1 expression
	in response to RA, whereas inhibition of RAF or MEK by inhibitors
	or knockdown of RAF by short interfering RNA diminished RA-induced
	BLR1 expression and attenuated differentiation and growth arrest.
	Ectopic expression of the RAF CR3, the catalytically active domain,
	in the BLR1 knock-out restored RA-induced MAPK activation and the
	ability to differentiate and arrest, indicating that RAF effects
	MAPK signaling by BLR1 to propel differentiation/arrest. Taken together,
	RA induces cell differentiation and growth arrest through activation
	of a novel MAPK pathway with BLR1 as a critical component in a positive
	feedback mechanism that may contribute to the prolonged MAPK signaling
	propelling RA-induced cell cycle arrest and differentiation.},

	are unknown. Evidence is presented herein that the Src homology 2
	(SH2) domain-containing leukocyte protein of 76 kDa (SLP-76) is a
	substrate of ZAP-70. Phosphorylation of SLP-76 is diminished in T

	Abstract = {The serine/threonine-specific protein kinase Raf-1 plays a key role
	in mitogenic signal transduction by coupling Ras to the mitogen-activated
	protein (MAP) kinase cascade. Ras-mediated translocation to the plasma
	membrane represents a crucial step in the process of serum-stimulated
	Raf-1 kinase activation. The exact role of the multisite phosphorylation
	in Raf regulation, however, is not clear. We have previously reported
	that the mobility shift-associated hyperphosphorylation of Raf correlates
	with a reduction of serum-stimulated Raf kinase activity (Wartmann,
	M., and Davis, R. J. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 6695-6701). Here
	we show that incubation of serum-starved CHO cells with D609, a purported
	inhibitor of phosphatidylcholine-specific phospholipase C, also results
	in a mobility shift of Raf-1 that is due to hyperphosphorylation
	on sites identical to those observed following mitogen stimulation.
	Subcellular fractionation analyses revealed that D609-induced mobility
	shift-associated hyperphosphorylation was paralleled by a decreased
	membrane association of Raf-1. Similar results were obtained in an

	Androgen [5alpha-dihydrotestosterone (DHT)] stimulation of LNCaP
	prostate cancer cells, which have constitutive phosphatidylinositol
	3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway activation due to PTEN loss, caused increased
	expression of cyclin D1, D2, and D3 proteins, retinoblastoma protein
	hyperphosphorylation, and cell cycle progression. However, cyclin
	D1 and D2 message levels were unchanged, indicating that the increases
	in cyclin D proteins were mediated by a post-transcriptional mechanism.
	This mechanism was identified as mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)
	activation. DHT treatment increased mTOR activity as assessed by
	phosphorylation of the downstream targets p70 S6 kinase and 4E-BP1,
	and mTOR inhibition with rapamycin blocked the DHT-stimulated increase
	in cyclin D proteins. Significantly, DHT stimulation of mTOR was
	not mediated through activation of the PI3K/Akt or mitogen-activated
	protein kinase/p90 ribosomal S6 kinase pathways and subsequent tuberous
	sclerosis complex 2/tuberin inactivation or by suppression of AMP-activated
	protein kinase. In contrast, mTOR activation by DHT was dependent
	on AR-stimulated mRNA synthesis. Oligonucleotide microarrays showed
	that DHT-stimulated rapid increases in multiple genes that regulate
	nutrient availability, including transporters for amino acids and
	other organic ions. These results indicate that a critical function
	of AR in PTEN-deficient prostate cancer cells is to support the pathologic

	Abstract = {The cell differentiation of HL-60 human leukemic promyelocytes along
	the myeloid pathway due to various continuous and distributed exposures
	to retinoic acid was studied. HL-60 myeloid differentiation was a
	continuously driven process; significant terminal cell differentiation
	occurred only after a minimum exposure to inducer of two division
	cycles. Cells so committed to differentiation retained a heritable,
	finite memory of differentiation commitment over a further division
	cycle. Prior to becoming committed, cells acquired precommitment
	memory of exposure to inducer. Precommitment memory abbreviated the
	subsequent exposure to inducer needed for commitment to differentiation.
	Precommitment memory was semistable. It was heritable, but was lost
	after four division cycles. The acquisition and loss of precommitment
	memory correlated with alterations in nuclear architecture detected
	by narrow angle light scatter using flow cytometry. The altered nuclear
	architecture first occurred before any overt cell differentiation
	or growth arrest. It was thus an early event in the induced program
	of terminal cell differentiation. Alterations in relative abundances
	of cytoplasmic proteins also occurred prior to overt cell differentiation
	or growth arrest. One of these was a 17 kdalton, anionic, probably
	Ca2+ binding, protein. Retinoic acid thus induced early cellular
	changes, including cytoplasmic and nuclear alterations, within one
	cell cycle when cell differentiation was not yet apparent.},

	pathway--retinoic acid selectively utilizes ERK but not JNK/SAPK
	or p38 when inducing myeloid differentiation of HL-60 human myeloblastic

	or the delta205 mutant, which in addition is also weakened for activation

	cells. The data are consistent with a model in which signals originating
	with retinoic acid and c-FMS integrate to cause differentiation,
	RB hypophosphorylation, and G0 arrest. Furthermore, these two signals
	can compensate for each other. Three HL-60 sublines described previously
	(A. Yen et al., Exp. Cell Res., 229: 111-125, 1996) expressing low
	(wild-type HL-60), intermediate, and high cell surface c-FMS were
	treated with various concentrations of retinoic acid. The lowest
	concentration tested, 10(-8) M, induced significant differentiation
	of only the high c-FMS-expressing cells, with no accompanying hypophosphorylated
	RB or G0 arrest. The low and intermediate c-FMS expressing cells
	showed no induced differentiation, hypophosphorylation of RB, or
	G0 arrest. A 10-fold higher retinoic acid concentration, 10(-1) M,
	induced significant differentiation of both intermediate and high
	c-FMS-expressing cells. It induced RB hypophosphorylation only in
	high c-FMS-expressing cells but with no accompanying G0 arrest in

	M, elicited differentiation, hypophosphorylation of RB, and G0 arrest
	in low, intermediate, and high c-FMS-expressing cells. As the concentration
	of retinoic acid increased, cell differentiation, hypophosphorylation
	of RB, and G0 arrest were progressively elicited within this ensemble
	of cells with different c-FMS expression levels. Thus, for example,
	at the lowest concentration of retinoic acid, expression of high
	enough c-FMS still allowed differentiation. At higher concentrations,
	progressively less c-FMS was needed for differentiation. The apparent
	threshold for the sum of the retinoic acid plus c-FMS originated
	signals to elicit differentiation, hypophosphorylation of RB, and
	G0 arrest increased, in that order. Thus retinoic acid-induced cell
	differentiation, RB hypophosphorylation, and G0 arrest have different
	signal threshold requirements. 1,25-Dihydroxy vitamin D3, also a

	Abstract = {Expression of an activated raf transgene accelerated the terminal
	myeloid differentiation of HL-60 human promyelocytic leukemia cells
	induced by retinoic acid. A similar result was obtained when 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin
	D3 was used to induce monocytic differentiation. The stable transfectants
	were derived by transfecting HL-60 cells with DNA encoding an N-terminal
	truncated raf-1 protein. In normal HL-60 cells retinoic acid is known
	to induce a colony-stimulating factor-1 (CSF-1)-dependent metabolic
	cascade culminating in G0 arrest and phenotypic conversion. Early
	in this cascade, expression of the RB tumor suppressor gene product
	is down-regulated. A progressive redistribution of the form of the
	protein from largely hyperphosphorylated protein to the hypophosphorylated
	form begins later with G0 arrest and differentiation. In the activated
	raf-transfected cells, RB down regulation occurred more rapidly,
	consistent with accelerated differentiation. But the conversion to
	the hypophosphorylated form was not accelerated and occurred after
	G0 arrest and phenotypic conversion to myeloid differentiated cells.
	Thus raf activation appears to be a component of the induced metabolic
	cascade culminating in terminal differentiation. In this cascade
	raf activation promotes RB down-regulation. The data are consistent
	with a model in which raf is an effector of the CSF-1-dependent metabolic
	cascade which culminates in terminal cell differentiation, and RB
	downregulation is one of the downstream consequences of RAF action.
	Furthermore, they indicate that RB down-regulation may be an essential

	STAT1 Ser727 phosphorylation. Our experimental results show that
	UVA-induced Ser727 phosphorylation of STAT1 was, to different degrees,

	HER-2 receptor overexpression was evaluated using immunohistochemistry

	Abstract = {PURPOSE: The ErbB1 and ErbB2 receptors have been implicated in prostate
	cancer progression, but less is known about the role and biology
	of other ErbB receptor family members in prostate cancer. The aim
	of this study was to analyze the expression and localization of ErbB3
	in prostate tissues and prostate cancer cell lines. EXPERIMENTAL
	DESIGN: Immunohistochemistry of ErbB3 was done on prostate cancer
	tissue sections from 143 patients and on a tissue microarray containing
	390 cores of radical prostatectomy-derived specimens representing
	normal, prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia, and malignant tissues
	from 81 patients. ErbB3 subcellular localization was studied by Western
	blot analysis in LNCaP, 22Rv1, PC-3, and DU145 prostate cancer cell
	lines. RESULTS: Immunohistochemistry analysis of prostate cancer
	tissues revealed that >90\% of prostate cancer tissues displayed
	cytoplasmic ErbB3 staining. Minimal ErbB3 nuclear staining was observed
	in normal prostate tissues and benign prostatic hyperplasia tissues;
	in contrast, ErbB3 was frequently localized in the nucleus of cancerous
	tissues. This nuclear localization was more frequent (P < 0.001)
	in hormone-refractory tissues (17 of 17, 100\%) compared with hormone-sensitive
	samples (37 of 92, 40.2\%). Additionally, in the tissue microarray,
	increased nuclear ErbB3 was associated with increasing Gleason grade.
	Interestingly, Western blot analysis of cytoplasmic and nuclear subcellular
	fractions showed that ErbB3 nuclear localization was more prevalent
	in hormone-sensitive prostate cancer cell lines (LNCaP and 22Rv1)
	compared with hormone-insensitive cell lines (PC-3 and DU145). CONCLUSIONS:
	ErbB3 nuclear localization discriminates normal from malignant prostate
	tissues and between tumors from hormone-sensitive versus hormone-refractory
	prostate cancer. ErbB3 nuclear staining seems to be associated with
	risk of disease progression. The high frequency of ErbB3 nuclear
	localization in hormone-refractory tissues indicates that ErbB3 warrants
	further study to understand its association with prostate cancer
	disease progression.},

	Abstract = {Activating mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)
	tyrosine kinase domain determine responsiveness to EGFR tyrosine
	kinase inhibitors in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer
	(NSCLC). The modulation of transcriptional pathways by mutant EGFR
	signaling is not fully understood. Previously, we and others identified
	a single base pair change leading to a threonine to methionine (T790M)
	amino acid alteration in the ATP-binding pocket of the EGFR as a
	common mechanism of acquired resistance. The gefitinib-resistant,
	T790M-mutant H1975 NSCLC cell line undergoes prominent growth arrest
	and apoptosis when treated with the irreversible EGFR inhibitor,
	CL-387,785. We did a transcriptional profiling study of mutant EGFR
	target genes that are differentially expressed in the "resistant"
	gefitinib-treated and the "sensitive" CL387,785-treated H1975 cells
	to identify the pivotal transcriptional changes in NSCLC with EGFR-activating
	mutations. We identified a small subset of early gene changes, including
	significant reduction of cyclin D1 as a result of EGFR inhibition
	by CL-387,785 but not by gefitinib. The reduction in cyclin D1 transcription
	was associated with subsequent suppression of E2F-responsive genes,
	consistent with proliferation arrest. Furthermore, cyclin D1 expression
	was higher in EGFR-mutant lung cancer cells compared with cells with
	wild-type EGFR. EGFR-mutant cells were routinely sensitive to the
	cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor flavopiridol, confirming the functional
	relevance of the cyclin D axis. These studies suggest that cyclin
	D1 may contribute to the emergence of EGFR-driven tumorigenesis and
	can be an alternative target of therapy.},

	to create carboxy-terminal, affinity-tagged alleles of 1,000 open

	Abstract = {We reveiwed the relationships between ERBB2 amplification and/or overexpression

	in the literature (97 studies involving 22,616 patients) in order
	to draw conclusions regarding its clinical interest. The mean of
	ERBB2 positivity (26\%, ranging from 5 to 55\%) is not dependent
	on the method used to evaluate ERBB2 amplification or overexpression.
	Despite the discrepancies observed between the different studies,
	several associations between ERBB2 positivity and the classical clinicopathological
	parameters were noted. There are clear relationships between ERBB2
	positivity and the lack of steroid receptors, the histological subtypes
	of mammary tumours (ductal invasive and in situ), worse histological
	and nuclear grades, aneuploidy and high rate of proliferation. In
	univariate analyses, ERBB2 is strongly associated with poor prognosis.
	All these data indicate that ERBB2 is a marker of aggressiveness
	of the tumour. However, ERBB2 does not retain a clinical prognostic
	significance in multivariate analyses, since it is associated with
	several strong prognostic parameters. When considering the prognostic
	value of ERBB2 in relation to treatment, a significantly worse survival
	of the treated patients is noted in ERBB2 positive patients. This
	suggest that ERBB2 could be a marker of reduced response to chemotherapy
	and hormonal treatment. With respect to the tumour response to treatment,
	the results, provided as yet by pilot studies, remain controversial
	and further investigations are necessary to evaluate the predictive
